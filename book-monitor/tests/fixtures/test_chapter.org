#+TITLE: Test Chapter
#+AUTHOR: Test Author

* First Chapter Title

This is the introduction to the first chapter. It contains some regular text that should be counted.

** First Section

This is the content of the first section. It has multiple sentences and should be counted properly.

The section continues with more content here.

** Second Section :tag1:tag2:

This section has tags that should be removed from the title.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def example():
    print("This code should not be counted")
#+END_SRC

But this text after the code block should be counted.

** Third Section

Final section with some content.

* Second Chapter Title

This is a second top-level heading, but it should be ignored by the parser since we only process the first one.

** This section should not be processed

Because it's part of the second chapter.
