* Intro / Purpose
For me to learn from you, and maybe see if any challenges can be helped by the ideas I'm working on.

Time check: 45 minutes?

Theme: challenges w/ stakeholders, maybe more broadly -- how to create value, solve business problems.

My background -- spent a long time building, the move to product, back to building, then leading and managing, over both. Love the intersection of the two.
