* Engineers Don't Want To Explain Why

If the engineers are, in fact, using tech debt to talk about "bad code" they wish to remove, they won't think about making that potential value more visible.

Instead they'll feel (and often say!):

"Why should I have to *prove* that fixing bad code is important? Shouldn't I be *trusted* to know what high quality code is? Isn't that my *job*?"
