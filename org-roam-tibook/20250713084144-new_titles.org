* Current Leader

Engineers & The Creation of Value: How to Win *With* Your Stakeholders

* Problem Statements
From EWJ: /Trying to put myself back into the early-to-mid-manager times of my life, what I remember is feeling, like, some guilt around tech debt, and some vague anger that my business partners didn't "get it."  But I remember feeling full-on desperation, which almost led to my quitting the industry, because it seemed like my stakeholders were asking for crazy shit / were focused on completely arbitrary deadlines / clearly didn't trust me, and I didn't trust them, because half the shit we worked on never launched, and half of what remained no one used./

E.g. building trust, breaking work down to offer meaningful increments, understanding how value is created in a business, advocating for either specific approaches or specific technical investments, pushing back without creating bad will

* How Would Engineers Describe This Problem

Fix Your Stakeholders

Win Without Estimates

Align With Your Stakeholders

Align With the Business

My Business Is Crazy, What Do I Do?

People are asking for the impossible

We Can't Win

How Engineers +Can't+ Can Win

I think there's something deadlines, projects, milestones, estimates

And something else about building trust with product/stakeholders

And something smaller about maintaining trust with the team
