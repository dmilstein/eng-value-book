* Climb the Ladder of Commitment

** On the Side

Usually, small efforts that someone can knock off in between other tickets, or over a weekend.

Pros:

 - Can be done without formal negotiation with Stakeholders

 - Particularly useful for creating initial visibility

Cons:

 - Tough to make progress against significant challenges

 - Risk of creating culture where key tech investments can only be done by heroic "extra" work (especially if the people who do this are rewarded/promoted)

 - Missed opportunity to educate and involve stakeholders

** A Single Ticket

A day or a couple of days of work for one engineer.

** A Within-Team Project

A week or a couple of weeks of work for a few engineers on one team.

** A Cross-Team Initiative

A month or a couple of months of work for multiple engineers across multiple teams.

** A Durable Team

A year or a couple of years of work for multiple engineers, a manager, someone serving the PM role.

E.g. DevEx or DevPlat, various flavors of Platform teams. Maybe, see Team Topologies.

Key question:

 - Who serves the product role?

 - Do they report up through product or through engineering?
