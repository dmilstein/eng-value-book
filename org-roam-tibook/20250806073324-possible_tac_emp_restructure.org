#+title: Possible Tac Emp Restructure
What if, for [[id:4FEA3BD5-8E85-4BB6-8F59-15FDE4F38572][Build Influence Through Empathy]], instead of having it be a full separate chapter, I speak to it, speak to the value of it, early on, maybe give a single example (echoing?), and then, throughout, have an end-of-chapter sidebar for new tactics?

Because it's feeling a bit weighty right now?

And then I could put them all in an Appendix, with concrete exercises for each, but not have those exercises be in the flow of the book?

How might I distribute skills:

Intro: Repeat Trailing Three Words

Align With Intent: echo back and summarize

Maps Fears & Aspirations: Label feelings, offer understanding  (+ make your stakeholder beleauguered hero)

Design an Increment of Change: None?

Deliver a Pitch: Play low status to inject your concerns

Clear the Decks: None

Celebrate Wins: ?

I... think I like this.
