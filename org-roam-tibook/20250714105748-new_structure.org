#+title: New Structure

Part of [[id:42FF29AB-A3A1-4307-85E5-69C08C7D4DB4][Reframe/Restructure]], also working on [[id:5DCF4CB9-9186-48DD-B1B8-01E09702F04A][New Titles]]

* Random Thinking
There was something really good in TIB, which was thinking of the effort as a cycle, that gradually climbs a ladder of trust. That's what I tell engineers to do -- solve a problem for your stakeholder, build trust, solve bigger problems, get into partnership, etc.

So I think I want to keep that -- and it give them a thing to do, like, right now (start at the low end).

In the old structure, I had that cycle spread across two overall parts -- but I liked a lot about that.

Alternately, I could have part I be, like, a quick trip through the loop, for something fairly small scale.

And then Part II is going back to each step and showing more advanced ways to do it?

So, then what, Part I is for junior eng managers/tech leads and part II is for more senior folks w/ more scope?

Hmm.

Is this How to be A PM, for Engineers?

Yes and very much no. This will cover applying PM skills to the engineering job. You'll still need to do almost all of this, even if you have a high-functioning PM team
