* Gathering Feedback
Robfitz's tool to gather feedback write better books

https://helpthisbook.com/

Costs $30/month, but I think that's very much likely worth it, once I have something for which I want feedback

Just commit to Substack, wherever I wrote out my todos

** Medium
I have... 5 email subscribers. I can potentially try to get more. But, hmm.

And it says: NOTE: Email addresses are no longer shared with writers when readers subscribe to receive email notifications about stories from a writer. Writers can continue to export their existing email lists.

So that sounds like a bit old no.

** What is the RSS story?

** Comparisons

*** [[https://memberful.com/blog/substack-vs-medium/][Medium vs Substack: A comparison of two popular publishing platforms]]

"Medium provides a streamlined experience for writers to publish articles and reach a built-in audience, while Substack empowers writers to take control of their content and develop a direct relationship with their readers."

"From monetization opportunities to audience ownership, Substack allows writers to take charge of their creative journey and build a sustainable career. In contrast, Medium, which was launched in 2012, has been a pioneer in the content creation space, offering a platform for writers to share their work with a built-in audience."
