Tell the story? Link to my videos/talks?

How much do I want to bring how I/we run post-mortems to life? I mean, *some* or people will have literally no idea what I'm talking about.

I do have "EN-How To Facilitate a Post-Mortem-310325-142830.pdf" in SavedEllevationFiles, which is pretty far along the path to a write up on how to run them. Maybe shove that in an appendix.


Theory: post-mortems make risks visible. They are early-warning signs.

How much advice do I give on actually running post-mortems?

Where did we get lucky?

Examples:

 - Site fell over because a change to auth locked all users out

   Risk = hard to safely change auth code, poor testing, monitoring

 - System locked up under load

 - Customer deleted a bunch of data

 - Team deleted a bunch of data
