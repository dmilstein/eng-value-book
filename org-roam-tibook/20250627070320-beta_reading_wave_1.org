#+title: Beta Reading Wave 1
A place to take notes on [[id:93FF0A9B-F54E-49D5-8154-640BBAE08D4D][Beta Readers]].

* Plan <2025-06-27 Fri>
Broadly, I need to:

** Load into HTB, in a repeatable fashion
I think, yes, take some time to make it scriptable, to lower cost of future work.

I'm close, with pandoc.

** Decide: how many readers do I want?

** Write my "do you want to be a beta reader" invite
Steal from WUB

** Decide where / how to post that

** Decide who / how to ask about that

** Write my "guide for beta readers", load into HTB
Steal from WUB

** Start the campaign

** Build a habit for checking progress
Could easily lose my mind, be careful.
