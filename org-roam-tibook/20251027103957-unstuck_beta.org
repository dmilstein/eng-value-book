Current ToC

  Chapter 1: Introduction: The Joys and Pains of Working With Humans

  Part I: How to Solve Problems So You Can Solve Problems
    Chapter 2: The Getting Unstuck Game Plan
    Chapter 3: Align On a Strategic Outcome
    Chapter 4: Mine for Fears & Dreams
    Chapter 5: Make a Compelling Offer
    Chapter 6: /Quin & Marco Go For A Walk/

I think, get rid of the Part I/Part II, but do the three part breakdown of compelling offer, so it becomes something like:

  1. The Joys and Pains of Working With Humans
  2. The Getting Unstuck Game Plan
  3. Align On a Strategic Outcome
  4. Mine for Fears & Dreams
  5. The Elements of a Compelling Offer
  6. Offer A Small, Easy-To-Agree-To Change
  7. Motivate Action (Now and Not Later)
  8. Speak To Your Stakeholder's Human Experience
  9. /Quin & Marco Go For A Walk/

In the vicinity of 30,000 words, give or take 5,000 words, at a guess. 150 minutes, call it 3 hours of reading.

* Open Questions/Work I've Considered Doing
** Review/merge new Intro ideas in [[file:20250913100150-make_a_compelling_offer.org::*Introduction][Compelling Offer]]
All the stuff I have written in for Substack. Also maybe I have something in the abortive "Four Key Feelings" in sub
** Review Strategic Outcome chapter
Comb through all the substack writing, strip it down and simplify.

** Review/merge from [[file:~/Dropbox/Projects/TechInvestBook/substack/013-four-emotions.org::*Fears & Dreams & Humans & Building Softare: Part I][4 Emotions]] substack
And, not, I develop a whole narrative in there.

** Experiment: Quin & Marco as separate chapters
Move to interstitial chapters? Keep woven through? Get back to them... when?

** Experiment: lots of little stories vs one big story
** Split out Compelling Offer, review

* Target Date
December 5th is 5 weeks out.

What would a week by week breakdown look like, to get to that date? Let's look by end of week dates:

** 11/07: Review/merge new Intro ideas in Compelling Offer
** 11/14: Review Strategic Outcome chapter
*** Experiment: Quin & Marco as separate chapters
** 11/21: Review/merge from 4 Emotions substack
*** Experiment: lots of little stories vs one big story
