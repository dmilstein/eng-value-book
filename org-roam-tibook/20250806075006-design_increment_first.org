#+title: Design Increment First?
As part of [[id:5C66C3D5-7292-4E80-AE8A-D7904723D091][New ToC]] / [[id:42FF29AB-A3A1-4307-85E5-69C08C7D4DB4][Reframe/Restructure]], what if I was, instead of going through the game plan in order, to start with designing an increment of change, on the theory that that lets me speak to what they immediately want, which is to envision a better way of working? And then I can name a few, and/or quote source material. And promise that in the second half I'll have full case studies?

** Part I - The Game Plan
*** Design an Increment of Change
*** Define a Strategic Intent (echo back & summarize)
*** Map Fears & Aspirations (offer labeled understanding / beleaguered hero)
*** Craft a Compelling Pitch
 - Draw in organizational authority/allies
 - Creating pain / making pain visual
*** Clear the Decks & Stack the Deck
*** Celebrate Wins With Storytelling
