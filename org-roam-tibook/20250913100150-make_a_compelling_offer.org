* Make a Compelling Offer
** Define An Increment of Change

You're going to ask your stakeholder to make a /slightly uncomfortable/ change.

Ideally, you want this small adjustment to create three distinct kinds of wins:

 - It makes things a little better for you

 - It makes things a little better for your stakeholder

 - It moves you both a little closer to your shared long-term goals

This is where the work you've done to dig into your stakeholder's fears, frustrations, delights and dreams really pays off. That map of their emotional landscape will make it possible to come up with an incremental improvement that addresses your concerns, while also *feeling good* to them.

To define a specific adjustment, I recommend going through the following four steps in some order. Personally, when I do this work, I tend to loop around, jumping back and forth and refining, eventually honing in on something.

In the next few sections, I'll list some tactics to explore, as you do this work.
*** Connect your work to strategic goals

Lay out the steps in a logical chain that lead from what your team is doing, right now, to what your business is trying to achieve, a year or more from now.

Be certain you see how small changes in how you work with your stakeholder could increase the odds (even slightly) of the business achieving those long-term goals.

I'll describe a tactic for doing this, in "Working Backwards With Whys", below.

Understanding this linkage is important for two reasons. First, your stakeholder cares a lot about those long-term goals, so this will help make your offer compelling. Second, pressure-testing this connection will, well, keep you honest with yourself. Do your current frustrations actually matter? If so, why?

*** Find wins for your stakeholder

Beyond speaking to the long-term goals, you want to pair your request for a change with an offer to improve *something* for them. That could be removing something that is actively frustrating them, or promising to give them something that they want, but aren't currently getting.

If there is seemingly /nothing/ frustrating for your stakeholder, and they seem to have no strong desires, see the later section on "Creating Urgency".

*** Identify potential losses for your stakeholder

Your stakeholder will often be afraid that, if things change, they'll lose something they currently value or enjoy.

You want to know what they might be afraid of losing, so that you can carefully address that in your request for change. Sometimes that means reassuring then that they won't lose that thing, sometimes it means supplying them with an alternative. And sometimes it means directly asking them to give it up, but doing so clearly and with empathy.

*** Define and test an adjustment

Sketch in some different way of working, and then check if it's slightly better for you, your stakeholder, and the business.

Check if it is too big a change to take on, all at once. If so, go back and make it more incremental.

Be ready to spend some real time thinking on this. In my experience, there isn't usually an immediately obvious first increment. It takes some creative design. Talk to some friends about good patterns of work, test out your thinking with people you trust. Sleep on it, and see if any new ideas come to you the next day.

I'll describe a tactic for doing this, in "Imagine a Better World", below

** Tactic: Work Backwards With Whys

You need to develop a logical chain that leads from what your team is doing, right now, to what your business is trying to achieve, at some point in the future.

And, specifically, the strategic intent you've extracted from your stakeholder.

That can feel overwhelming. It can feel very difficult to see the impact of our day-to-day work on some distant goal.

One way to break this down is to simply name the immediate frustration you're experiencing, and ask "Why is this a problem for the business?".

Then, whatever answer you come up with, ask that same "Why" question again. Keep doing that, over and over, until you eventually arrive at the strategic intent you've extracted from your stakeholder. If you can't get there, talk to some people, keep refining your understanding of the business.

For example, meet Sagar, the engineering lead on a sprint team.

Sagar is getting more and more frustrated, because the sales team keeps pestering him and his team with an endless series of 'urgent' new feature requests. When a sales rep doesn't get an immediate response, they ping Sagar to "check status" over and over. Last month, at the company party, Sagar saw Jordy, a sales rep, striding towards him with a big grin on his face, and Sagar had an overwhelming desire to run away, out of fear that Jordy would try to get him to commit to working on his pet feature.[fn:: He was right.]

Sagar has been trying to get his product manager, Emily, to step in and wrangle the sales team, but, so far, she's been unwilling to do so. He's decided that, for his current bid for incremental improvement, Emily is his stakeholder.

He has extracted a meaningful strategic intent from her: their company needs a new product in order to keep growing revenue, and Sagar's team's work is a part of trying to develop that product.

How can he map the steps in the chain? Let's ask "Why".

  - Why is it a problem for the business that the sales team keeps interrupting engineers with 'urgent' feature requests?

    /Because it's distracting the engineers/

  - Why is it a problem for the business that the engineers are distracted?

    /Because the team as a whole can't move quickly/

  - Why is it a problem for the business that the team isn't moving as fast as it could?

    /Because it's pushing out the delivery of the early prototypes we're trying to build/

  - Why is it a problem for the business if it takes a little longer to build those prototypes?

    /Because we need to test those prototypes with customers before we can find our next product opportunity/

  - Why is it a problem for the business if it takes a little longer to find our next product opportunity?

    /Because we need to develop a new product to sell, and before we can commit to development, we need to identify a feasible and valuable product opportunity/

  - Why is a problem for the business if it has to wait a little longer to develop a new product?

    /Because top-line revenue growth has stalled, and the company needs to show more growth by our next funding round, which is fast approaching, and we can only show more growth if the sales team has something new to sell/

With that end-to-end understanding in hand, Sagar can *authentically* explain how a small reduction in the frequency of interruptive requests from the sales team can, in a small but real way, increase the odds of the company achieving its long-term goals.

Having all those specific steps gives him much more clear ammunition than just a vague sense that they're not working fast enough. It also pairs well with "Create Visibility To Create Urgency" -- once you understand the steps in the chain, you can make blockers or slowdowns more visible *at those steps*.

** Tactic: End With A Decision

One powerful thing to do is to ensure that your initial, timeboxed increment of change ends with a *decision* that your stakeholder gets to make.

That will help them feel in control, which makes it much easier for them to say yes.

For example, say Timofey is a product manager who is struggling with his engineering peer Lizabet. She's the tech lead for their team, and she insists that Timofey write extremely detailed tickets before she'll let the team spend any time sizing or starting the work. Liza insists this is necessary to avoid wasting the team's time. However, in the past Timofey has worked on teams where the engineers and PM's talked all the time, leaned on much lighter and more informal tickets, and things went much faster.

He goes through the various steps we've laid out, and comes up with a proposed increment that includes some things that he knows Lila really wants (e.g. a carve out of eng time to improve deploy, a long-time team frustration). The "slightly uncomfortable" change he asks for is to bring a much lighter set of tickets to sprint planning, and then spend time discussing the nuances, all togeher. He also commits to, throughout the sprint, being available to answer any and all engineering questions at the drop of a hat.

Finally, to ensure that Lizabet feels in control, as she takes this risk, he says:

"Also, I want to get a meeting on the calendar, now, for just after we've completed our first increment. I'll want to hear from you how this change has been working for the team, and if there's anything that's been difficult about it. Then we can decide, together, if and how we want to adjust this new way of working. I want to be certain the engineers don't feel like we're wasting their time."

** How To Make Your Offer

I'm going to map out a step-by-step plan. I'll encourage you to try to methodically work through the steps, without rushing. It's designed to gradually move your stakeholder to a willingness to consider a new way of working.

You should deliver yor proposal verbally -- that will let you share your (authentic!) emotional connection with their hopes and fears. If useful, you can certainly buttress what you say with a written memo or a set of slides. But find a way to connect, as humans, in this moment.

In order to make your proposal, create a space slightly outside of the normal flow of day-to-day pressures. That could simply be starting a regular 1:1 by saying "I have some concerns I want to talk out, can I ask to put aside our normal agenda for today?" Or it could mean breaking normal patterns, perhaps meeting in person instead of online. You want to signal that there's something important for you to face, together.

Once you've created that bit of space, go through the following steps, checking for understanding with your stakeholder after each one:

 - Name the strategic intent

 - Speak to their concerns

 - Speak to your concerns

 - Carefully and clearly explain your proposed adjustment

 - Ask for commitment

Before you make your proposal, *practice*. Out loud.

First on your own, then with a trusted friend. At least once, maybe a few times.

Eventually, going through this arc will feel natural, and you won't need to practice as much. But, early on, you're going to want to be extremely disciplined about going through the steps in sequenc. It's incredibly easy to skip over important steps, which can leave your stakeholder unwilling to say yes.

For high stakes such proposals, I still practice over and over, until it feels fully clear, smooth and authentic.

** Our Story: Quin Prepares A Compelling Offer

At All Together Now, Quin desperately wants Marco to stop jumping into standups and blowing up the team's focus by brainstorming new product ideas.

# Quin's biggest problem at ATN is that Marco keeps jumping into standups and blowing up the team's focus by brainstorming new product ideas.

Some part of her wants to just throw some book about agile or scrum in his direction, along with a lecture about the proper way to add new ideas to the team's backlog. But, having talked to him, she knows he's feeling very under the gun about getting something into customer's hands. She's pretty worried that, if she pushes, again, for a big change, he'll refuse, *again*.

*** Connect your work to strategic goals

However, thanks to her having drawn him out, Quin knows that Marco's under the gun feeling is driven by a deep fear that ATN might be building something that customers won't actually use. As it happens, Quin has that exact same fear, in spades. The various team-building games they've been developing on all feel like they /might/ be fun... but they all depend on users being willing to playfully engage in some pretty oddball online activities. There's just no way to really know how that goes until they see it in action.

Quin decides that, whatever she proposes, she's going to anchor it in a shared goal of delivering something, as soon as possible, that will allow ATN to get their games into the hands of early adopter users.

As she writes that down in her notes, she realizes that she can explicitly link that to their long-term objectives---because, when she dug into strategic goals for the next year, Marco told her that VC's would only consider a further round of investment if ATN could show *engagement*. Moving a step closer to getting games into the hands of users will move them towards learning, asap, if they're going to be able to generate engagement. As Quin makes this connection, she feels a spike of excitement. She can't wait to share this with her team---they've been hungry for a better understanding of *why* they're working on the various features and games.

But, she thinks with an internal sigh, they won't be able to make much progress if Marco keeps derailing every other standup with ideas from customer calls.

*** Find wins for your stakeholder

She turns her attention to how, exactly, she wants to ask him to change his behavior. At some level, she thinks, her ask is dead simple: just stop bringing new ideas to standup, and operate like a normal stakeholder. But she knows that's going to be a bit of a struggle for him. She tries to think about what she can offer, to make him willing to try.

As per her mentor's advice, she starts by thinking about the *frustratations* she believes Marco is currently feeling. If she can offer him something that will remove a frustration or add something he's missing, that could make him willing to consider a change.

In terms of their day-to-day, her list of Marco's frustrations is:

 a) He's not seeing rapid progress

 b) He feels like it's been /forever/ since he's been able to interact with anything new

Given that understanding of his feelings, she decides to design her proposed initial increment to deliver a *visual prototype* that Marco can interact with. That way, if he can commit to a relatively brief period of changing his behavior, the team can, at the end of that period, give him something that will feel truly exciting.[fn:: You might be thinking, "But, hang on, what if delivering a visual prototype is not the most valuable thing for the team to be doing right now?" In fact, if you know me, you might be putting your hands angrily on your hips and saying, "Look, Dan, I've spent hours of my life, reading thousands of words of *your* writing about how teams should always priortize their work based on the biggest risk. What if building the visual prototype doesn't address ATN's biggest risk?" Great question! In my experience, building trust and rapport with a key stakeholder is *well* worth the cost of working on something that is /theoretically/ off the critical path of learning. Another way to put it is: if you and your key stakeholder aren't able to work effectively together, *that* is one of your biggest risks. Getting into effective collaboration is therefore likely the most valuable thing you can do.]

In thinking back over the last month of development, she realizes that the team has put together most of the bits of one specific activity: the Virtual Dunk Tank![fn:: For this ridiculously early version of the VDT, some leader will hold a bowl of water over their own head, and, once enough people on their team have hit the virtual targets on each of their own screens, a buzzer sounds and the leader has to dump the water on themselves.]

If the team could just have a couple of weeks without distractions, she'll bet they could get that into demo-able state. She can almost see it, already.

She's just about ready to nail down her proposal, but then she catches herself. Her mentor insisted she take the time to ask: "What about the current situation is *good* for Marco? What might he be worried about giving up, if he agrees to make this change?"

*** Identify potential losses for your stakeholder

Marco clearly *loves* coming directly to standup, while his experience of talking to a customer is fresh in his mind. Quin has realized that he specifically loves that because it allows him to clarify his thinking. But that's exactly what is blowing up the team's focus. She feels stuck. How can he brainstorm with the team, while not brainstorming with the team? Should she just point blank tell him he has to give that up? She... could. But she worries about where that pent up energy will go.

*** Define and test an adjustment

The next morning, while walking her dog, Quin suddenly has an idea. She rushes home and writes out her proposed first increment of change:

 - For the next two weeks Marco will agree to stop coming to the team after customer calls

 - Instead, he will always first meet with Quin, one-on-one

 - Quin will commit to being ready to drop everything and meet with him the moment he gets off a call, while his thoughts are fresh

 - Otherwise, Marco can continue to interact with the team as he wishes

 - At the end of the two weeks, the team will share an interactive demo of the Virtual Dunk Tank for Marco to test out

 - Immediately after that demo, Marco and Quin will meet and decide two things: a) what next steps they want to take with the Virtual Dunk Tank, and b) what further adjustments they want to make in how they're working together.

She sits back. This feels good. She has to figure out how, exactly, she'll pitch it to Marco. But it feels good.

Quin has arrived at a very well-designed request. The proposed change will be "slightly uncomfortable" for Marco. He will, in his excited moments immediately after getting off a customer call, have to stop himself, and *not* do what feels natural to him. He'll have to do some work to remap his instincts.

But if Quin can get Marco to try it, this new way of working could generate wins across all three fronts:

 - It positions Quin to buffer the team from Marco's initial swirl of thoughts, immediately after he's talked with customers. This addresses one of her biggest concerns.

 - It gives Marco a small, immediate reward: Quin's immediate attention and thought partnership after customer calls. This preserves something good about the current situation.

 - It gives Maco another reward, at the end of the increment: an opportunity to try out an interactive demo of the Virtual Dunk Tank. This will give him both the sense of velocity and the interactive UI that he's been growing increasingly desperate for.

 - The creation of that demo will move ATN one step closer to being able to ask a customer to *use something*. That moves both her *and* Marco towards their shared strategic goal around engagement.

Finally, by explicitly putting an end-of-increment decision on the table, Quin ensures that Marco will feel like he retains control. She's making it clear, with her actions, that if he ends up frustrated by something in this new way of working, he'll have a time to speak to those frustrations.

Even more fundamentally, she's increasing his control over his ultimate goals. Being able to review a demo of the Virtual Dunk Tank creates new options for the business. By inviting Marco to start thinking about those options, she's giving him something he very badly wants.

** Our Story: Quin Delivers Her Compelling Offer

Quin and Marco have gone for a walk together downtown. As they get into the city park, Quin asks if they can stop on a bench to talk. They sit side by side, watching people walk by.

*** Name the strategic intent

"As I understand it," Quin says, "ATN!'s most important goal is to have a set of *engaged customers* within six to eight months. Potential investors in a next round are going to want to see happy users, running *actual* team activities on the platform--not just a couple of big sales. Given that, our current goal is to *very* quickly build something that is "*just 'Good Enough*'". Something we can get into the hands of a few early customers, and then make better *with* them. Do I have that right?"

She has spoken to the strategic intent, using some of his own words ("just 'Good Enough'", "make better with them"). She's also spoken to one of his biggest fears (that they won't see actual use), but done so in the "positive form", of the good thing they *want* to have happen.

Marco nods for her to go on.

Quin takes a breath. "Unfortunately, I'm worried that we're struggling to move fast enough. Unless we make some changes, I think we might not have a product *any* customer will be able to actually use until early next year."

Marco frowns unhappily. This isn't shocking news, but it doesn't feel good to hear it said out loud.

Note how Quin has named a desirable outcome, and then shared a specific "danger" that might make it impossible to achieve that outcome. This is powerful rhetorical tactic. It creates suspense that will make your listener sort of lean forward to hear more.[fn:: It does so by adapting the story-telling structures that are wired deeply into the human mind.]

*** Speak to their concerns

"Whatever changes we make," Quin continues, as a breeze stirs leaves in front of their bench, "I want to be certain we solve for a few things. First, I want to be sure you can actually *see* that the team is moving faster---I worry that we've drifted a bit into building separate bits and pieces of the final product, but we're not regularly putting together visual prototypes that you can test out and react to."

Quin has immediately shown that she cares about both Marco's biggest frustration (that the team isn't moving fast enough) and one of his potential delights (being able to interact with a visual UI).

Marco nods. He would certainly be happy if the team shipped, well, anything. He'd be even more happy if it was a thing he could *see*.

She continues, "Finally, I want to be certain that, immediately after you talk to customers, you have a chance to think through what you've heard, while it's still fresh in your mind. Most of the time, we won't adjust what the team is doing based on any one call, but, even if we don't, it's important to quickly update our shared understanding of customer needs."

Quin has spoken to preserving something he cares about. She's pauses and checks in, before she moves on.

"Does that sound about right?"

Marco replies, somewhat cautiously, "That sounds mostly right, yeah."

He is remembering that Quin had recently demanded he *stop* talking to the team immediately after calls. He's not certain where she's going, but he appreciates that she now seems to understand why it's so important that he can process those calls right away. In fact, he likes the way she frames it: "quickly update a shared understanding of customer needs." That gets at it well.

He also thinks that, of course he understands that they're not to ask the team to change everything based on one customer call. He's not unreasonable.

*** Speak to your concerns

Having heard his agreement about how she's framed his concerns, Quin is ready to move on to her own.

She has spent a bit of time thinking about how to avoid any kind of accusation that could trigger defensiveness, so she says:

"One thing I worry about is that I think the team doesn't have as much context as you and I do. So, when you come back from a customer call, and share what you've heard and learned, they sometimes get confused. They're not sure what is extra context, and what represents a real change in direction. That confusion is starting to add up. I want them to go faster, but we've been losing time when engineers went off in some new direction after one of thoses sessions."

Marco nods, slowly.

Note how Quin subtly positioned this as a "weakness" of her and the team, rather than a "failing" on the part of Marco. She could easily have said "The way you're constantly bringing in new ideas is causing problems", but, instead, by playing just a bit of low status, she is sharing a problem to solve together---where the "problem" is "the team can't follow your new ideas", not "you're being chaotic and unfocused". Those are actually exactly the same problem, just focused on different perspectives. The non-accusational framing makes it easier for Marco to stay with her.

*** Propose a period of change

Now Quin will walk through what she's worked out, and be very direct and very specific about what she's asking of Marco:

"I'd like to try a small change, for the next two weeks. Whenever you get off a customer call, I'll ask you to ping me on Slack. I'll drop whatever else I'm doing, and you and I can do an immediate debrief. That'll give you a chance to really think through what you've heard, while it's still fresh. If something important comes up, I can share our current status with you, and we can make an immediate call about any priority changes to bring to the team."

"That's most of it. I would ask that, if, during one of those debriefs, I tell you that the team is super heads down, that you wait to give them the full update. But we don't need to be too formal about that."

Note how extremely specific she is being, about what she is asking: "Whenever you get a customer call, ping me on Slack". That's far, far better than saying "Can you please stop coming to standups", or tip-toeing around it, ala, "I don't know maybe you and I could check in, sometimes, before you talk to the team?" You want to give your stakeholder a crisp, specific thing to visualize themselves doing.

"I'm hopeful that, if we do this, I can really focus with the team, and we can have a demo of the Virtual Dunk Tank ready by end of sprint."

She's immediately followed up her request with a benefit he'll get --- a demo of a feature he's been waiting on, for a while.

She moves on to the future decision.

"Finally, I want to set a meeting up, for immediately after that end-of-sprint demo, for you and I to review how close the Dunk Tank is to sharing with customers and what, if anything, we want to keep tweaking to ensure the team can move faster."

Note how she's mixing a business decision (What do we do with the cool new Dunk Tank?), with a collaboration decision (what do we want to tweak?)

Also, she is *not* offering a Yes/No decision. She could have said "if we want to keep working this way." You... can do that, in particular if it feels incredibly risky to your stakeholder to try this change. But you're generally better off drawing them into shared problem solving, so that the decision is about *how to continue to solve the problem together*, not simply yes/no on one specific practice.

*** Ask for commitment

Now, to be clear, Marco may not say yes immediately. But that's fine. Quin can probe for any hesitations and tweak the offer, until he's ready to try. Usually, if you've done the previous steps well, you can do that within the discussion, so you're emerging with a commitment to try something new.

** Troubleshooting
*** Stakeholder doesn't confirm Strategic Intent
*** Stakeholder doesn't validate summary of their concerns
*** Stakeholder doesn't accept your concerns
*** Stakeholder pushes back on specifics of change
** Exercises
* Scraps
** Tactic: End With A Decision

# Ensure Your Stakeholder Retains Control By Offering a Future Decision

# Offer a Future Decision To Maintain Feeling of Control

Almost all stakeholders have some fear of *losing control*.

# The fear of loss of control is incredibly common. We can *all* feel the risk of losing agency, of watching, powerless, as things all around us collapse into failure.

Such a fear can easily cause your stakeholder to tensely [rigidly] reject your proposal, even if you've gotten all the other pieces right.

Why is this?
# When people are operating from a place of fear, they can't engage in rational thought.

Having someone ask us to change our behavior can feel like a *criticism*. That can immediately raise the emotional stakes. From that place of heightened emotion, it's extremely easy to hear a request to change as a request to give up our control over a situation. Our fear will be shouting at us that, if we go along with the request, we will be completely at the mercy of a situation that is on the verge of tipping over into abject failure. The fear will be insisting that the only way to prevent that failure is to push back on this request, immediately.

# Humans, am I right? (I say this someone who has 100% done exactly this, plennnnty of times)

Fortunately, once you understand this, it's possible to design your proposal so that your stakeholder hears it as a way to *increase* their control---even as you ask them to make an uncomfortable change.

You create the feeling of control for your stakeholder by building your proposal around a *meaningful future decision*.

Specifically, you want your initial period of change to *explicitly* end with a decision your stakeholder will get to make. Ideally, you want that decision to be both about "Should we continue working in this new way", and *also* about if and how to pursue some new, potentially valuable, business option. This is part of why generating wins across all three fronts is so valuable.

When your stakeholder hears your request for change, you want them to, *as part of it*, be imagining that future moment of decision, of control. That will make it far easier for them to say yes.

** Defining an Increment: An Example

As is our way, we'll bring this to life with a story:

# Change from 3rd person to something else? "Lila is the engineering lead..."

Imagine that you're the engineering lead on a sprint team.

You're getting more and more frustrated, because the sales team keeps pestering you and your team with an endless series of 'urgent' feature requests. When a sales rep doesn't get an immediate response, they relentlessly ping some engineer to "check the status" of whatever they asked for. Last month, at the company party, a sales rep strode towards you with a big smile on their face, and you had to physically resist a desire to run away, fearing they'd try to get you to commit to working on their pet feature.[fn:: You were right.]

You've tried to get your product peer to step in and wrangle the sales team, but, so far, they've been unwilling to do so. You've decided that, for your current bid for incremental improvement, your product peer is "your stakeholder".

Let's dig into the steps:


*** Map from your team's day-to-day work to the company's strategic goals


*** List what is frustrating to your stakeholder, in the current situation.

In our story, thanks to having deployed your tactical empathy skills, you are in proud possession of two sources of frustration for your product peer.

First, the PM feels like the team should be moving faster, and every small delay in getting a prototype built frustrates them. The head of product is constantly asking them when they're going to take something into the field.

Second, the PM finds their interactions with the VP of Sales extremely frustrating. When the PM asks for justifications for feature requests, the VP of Sales just rolls their eyes and says "Look, you don't understand how the product actually works. Just let my team talk to the engineers, okay?"

Unfortunately, there's a grain of truth in this: for many feature requests, the PM feels out of their depth, and can't even have a first-order conversation about scope without having to turn around and interrupt the engineers themselves. That's part of why they're finding it easier to just stay out of the loop, and have pushed back on your requests to insert themselves back in.

Notice how tactical empathy has turned up something super valuable: frustrations you can commit to *improving*, if your stakeholder is willing to work with you.

*** List what your stakeholder *likes* about the current situation

In our story, a key benefit the product manager is getting is, well, *focus*. Because they're *not* spending time triaging and pushing back on requests from the sales team, they're able to work intensely with the designer and the engineers to shape the prototype. They *love* doing that kind of work. At some level, it's why they got into product management in the first place (a fact you learned by drawing them out via your tactical empathy skills)

Thus, as you go to design your request, you will want to find a way to speak carefully to the potential for added distractions for the PM.

*** Brainstorm how you can address your concerns, in the context of the above

One useful tactic can be to first let yourself imagine a Better World: some far better way of working, that is not possible to get to, immediately. Then, see if you can come up with a first small step in that direction.

In our story, such a Better World might be:

 - You, your PM and the VP of Sales have a regular meeting to review new feature requests

 - The VP of Sales brings a list of feature requests to that meeting

 - At the meeting, you, the PM and the VP of Sales priority sort that list, with an understanding that you'll only be able to work on the very top priorities

 - The PM has sufficient understanding of how the product works to participate usefully in that discussion

 - The VP of Sales uses their authority to ensure no one on their team reaches out directly to the engineers, outside of the above process

This is far too big a change to institute all at once, especially given the lack of trust between the product manager and the VP of Sales.

But, with that idea in mind, and knowing all of the above constraints, you could say:

 - You'll set up a new weekly Request Review meeting with you, one lead engineer, and the PM

 - You'll tell the engineers to just collect all feature requests for that meeting

 - You give the engineers a "form letter" response they can use for both feature requests and "status checks" from the sales team

 - You'll commit to spending time in that meeting helping the PM understand the product better, as you decide what to do

 - You can commit to the PM, that if you do the above, you can increase the speed of delivery of the new prototype

 - You commit to working with the PM to handle the VP of Sales, if they complain about this shift

You're almost ready to make our request.

But there's one final step, to make it as easy as possible for your stakeholder to agree to the proposal. We're going to make certain we speak to an underlying fear that just about all stakeholders share.

** Better World imagining
your first thought is: the sales team should just stop submitting requests, altogether. But you know that's not ideal for the business. Both because there is useful signal in the requests, and also because some of the requests are easy to build and will create a lot of value for modest effort.

You think about it while riding the subway home, you poll friends who work at other tech companies, you talk out options with the most experienced engineer on the team.

** Asking for a timeboxed period of change
You're going to ask your stakeholder to change their behavior for an initial, limited period of time. It's *much* easier for a stakeholder to say "yes" to a request to try something slightly uncomfortable for a few weeks, than it is to make an open-ended commitment to change indefinitely.

One subtlety: at this point, don't worry about exactly how you're going to *explain* this change to them. Instead, just focus on the details of your proposed adjustment.

Once you get a commitment to temporarily try something new, you can then work to ensure that, at the end of the testing period, the stakeholder experiences things as going great.

** Loss of Control
In a professional context, it starts because your stakeholder is working under the burden of some set of expectations -- from their boss, their board of directors, their peers, their spouse, even themselves. They will have a looming, background feeling that if they should fall short of those expecations---by failing to deliver, by missing stated or unstated goals---they will have *failed*. Actually, it's worse. Their fear is that, in those bad cases, they themselves will have *become a failure*. [fn:: It's possible I have known billionaires who struggled to sleep at night, out of the fear that everything they had buit was eroding in front of their eyes.]

Many of the actions they're doing today feel necessary to them, to prevent that failure. Those actions represent a way for them to exert control.


** Holme Quote
# No matter how rosy a picture they're trying to paint, there's some bedrock fear that things will go awry, and they will be left looking shamefully bad.

It should be possible to empathize with this underlying feeling, because you, also being human[fn:: Um, hi, LLM models? Laugh once if you're human?] likely work under a set of expecations yourself.

I'm gonna indulge myself by quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr (which quote I found in the life-changing Death and Life of Great American Cities, by Jane Jacobs):

/"We are all very near despair. The sheathing that floats us over its waves is compounded of hope, faith in the unexplainable worth and sure issue of effort, and the deep, sub-conscious content which comes from the exercise of our powers."/

The only thing that floats us over the waves of despair is "faith in [...] effort" and "the exercise of our powers."

I think that captures it, perfectly. When the specter of failure rises up in our minds, we to beat it back by taking *action*. By exercising our powers.

** Design an Increment of Change


# This is not yet the pitch itself.

There's a lot of art in this -- you've got to have some sense of what "better" looks like, and what a step in that direction might be. In later posts and/or the book, I'll be sharing case studies to bring this more to life, but for now I'll sketch in some ideas.

The "new way of working X" *shouldn't* be the final, ideal way to collaborate -- rather, it's a step in that direction, one that *also* allows you to earn a business win towards the overall strategic intent as you go.

The "new way of working X" should be designed with an explicit awareness of your stakeholder's fears and hopes -- whatever they most fear should be clearly and fully prevented from happening, and whatever they most hope for should be made *more* possible.

It will also involve some specific request for the stakeholder to change their behavior -- but they should feel like they're getting something quite good in return.

With the CEO we've been discussing, who keeps on driving the team crazy by interjecting new ideas into daily work, the core structure of the increment of change might be:

/For the next six weeks, the PM and engineering lead will add a pair of recurring meetings between the two of them and the CEO: one midway through each sprint, to check in on status and learnings, one immediately after each sprint demo, to discuss options for what the team works on next./

/They'll also add a once a month meeting where the CEO will meet with the whole team and share what he's been hearing from customers -- the PM will facilitate that meeting./

/The CEO will, during these six weeks, stop coming to team standups altogether (and will not slack or email ideas to team members)./

That gives the CEO a great deal of visibility, allows them to guide the overall work of the team and allows them to "directly" share what they're observing from customers.

I'll offer two other thoughts:

First, the increment should end with a *decision by your stakeholder*

E.g. the PM and Eng lead could say to the CEO something like:

/At the end of the six weeks, we're going to sit down with you and review the team's output and velocity, and also see if and how you've been able to both understand and guide the team's work./

/If necessary, we can make any needed adjustments to ensure that you're able to make clean decisions about what problems the team is solving. Let's get that meeting on the calendar now.../

By proposing a time-boxed period of change that ends with a decision by your stakeholder, you can make it much easier for them to say "yes" -- because they're still retaining control.

Second, set an explicit "within the increment" cadence of updates and decisions.

Many of these change involve *some* kind of "leave the team alone" shifts -- in those cases, it's worth defining some clear, controlled way that the stakeholder is having opportunities to understand what is going on, and to (appropriately!) influence it.

In the example above that's built-in, via the cadence of regular meetings.

** Craft a Pitch That Creates Urgency

Okay, now you're ready to put all that together into a *pitch*.

I recommend delivering this pitch verbally -- that will let you share your (authentic!) emotional connection with their hopes and fears. If useful, you can certainly buttress that with a written memo or a set of slides.

The arc you want to lead the stakeholder through should look something like:

 - Open with the strategic intent as context

 - Signal that you want to try something new

 - Name and validate their fears, in a way that lets you demonstrate your emotional alignment with them

 - Name the aspirational positive experience you want them to have (ideally, they have not been having this experience, of late).

 - Share your own concerns and fears -- the things about how you're operating now that make you worried you won't achieve the strategic intent

 - Describe your proposed increment of change, and, as part of it, name your key request of them -- how they'll have to act differently, for a period of time.

 - Share the decision they get to make at the end of the increment

 - Ask for feedback, ideas, concerns, questions

 - Adjust based on that, and then get a commitment to try something

A note: you should practice this with a trusted friend before you pitch your stakeholder. At least once, maybe a few times. For high stakes such proposals, I practice a ton.

For our CEO friend, putting that all together, the PM and Engineering lead might say something like:

/"Our understanding is that the company's absolutely highest priority is growth, because that is what potential acquirers will want to see. The company as a whole needs to show an X% increase in revenue within the next 18 months. Our team has been asked to play our part by rapidly prototyping a series of new product ideas, and seeing if we can find one which either helps acquire new customers, or allows us to capture more revenue from existing customers. We're very excited about that challenge. However, we do have a concern that we wanted to talk about with you./

/First off, we're worried that, as we're working right now, it can feel pretty unclear to you what, exactly, the team has prioritized at any given moment. We really want to fix that. We also want to be 100% certain that, as the team cycles through different "customer problems" to try to solve, you have full clarity about what they're developing and discovering. We want to have the best possible shot at building something that you'll be super excited to share with customers./

/Unfortunately, the way we're working right now, sometimes people on the team get confused by what they hear from you, when you join our stand ups. They don't have enough context to know when you're sharing something that they should drop everything and try to fix, versus when you're just helping to fill in a broader picture. That's been causing some churn, and we're running a risk of drifting behind./

/So, we'd like to try a tweak, for the next six weeks:/

/First, to be sure you have real clarity about what's going, we'll set up a new every-other week meeting with you and the two of us, where we'll bring a detailed status update on what's been built and what's been learned -- that'll land partway through each sprint./

/Second, we still very much want you to come to the end-of-sprint demos -- that is super valuable to us and the team. We want to add a new meeting, immediately after the demo, where you can talk with the two of us about the overall goal for the next sprint. Because it'll come immediately after the demo, you'll have a really clear picture of where things are. We can all three work together to make sure the team is pointed at the most important customer problem to solve./

/Finally, if you're up for it, we'd like to have you meet with the whole team once a month to have a sort of open conversation about what you've been hearing from customers -- we think it's super valuable for the team to get a feel for what's going on in the field. I [the PM] can facilitate that, so you can just show and be ready to share./

/We'd ask that, during this six weeks, you not come to standups -- and if you have any ideas, share them with one of us, instead of emailing or slacking people on the team./

/At the end of the six weeks, we'd going to sit down with you and review the team's output and velocity, and also see if and how you've been able to both understand and guide the team's work./

/If necessary, we can make any adjustments to ensure that you're able to make clean decisions about what problems the team is solving. Let's get that meeting on the calendar now.../
