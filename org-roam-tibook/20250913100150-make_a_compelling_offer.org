* Make a Compelling Offer
** The Elements Of A Compelling Offer

When you actually sit down with your stakeholder to ask them to change their behavior, you'll methodically go through the following four steps:

  1. Invoke the strategic outcome

  2. Share your understanding of their concerns

  3. Share your concerns

  4. Propose an adjustment in how you work together

# XXX Call back to the intro, where we explain why this works, cite books.

** Invoke The Strategic Outcome

State your understanding of both the key long-term goal, *and* your team's role in accomplishing that goal. Use their own words. Make it as clear and concise as possible:

/As I understand it, within the next two years our company needs to develop a new line of business, to demonstrate to investors that we can continue to grow. In order to do so, the company is building a new <Foo> product for people who run <Bar> departments in the <Baz> segment. My team will play a key role in that, by collecting and organizing data about <Quux>. Do I have that mostly right?/

Always check with your stakeholder after laying this out, ala "Do I have that mostly right?" If you see them hesitate, draw out any concerns and then adjust. Continue until it's clear you're stating the goal in a way they find *personally compelling*.

Why is this the first step?

By carefully anchoring the conversation in their long-term aspirations, you'll demonstrate that you are a potential partner for them. That they might be able to trust you to help them accomplish that goal. It also lifts the conversation out of day-to-day concerns, which starts to create a space to talk about how you work together.

Then, you calmly state that you believe the goal is at risk:

/"I have some concerns about our ability to build a <Foo> product fast enough. I want to talk those concerns out with you."/

If you've described a goal they truly care about, they will now listen carefully to whatever comes next.

** Share Your Understanding Of Their Concerns

Before describing any of your own concerns, first speak to the things that are difficult, or worrisome, or important for them. Show that you can put yourself in their shoes:

/"Whatever we do, I want to be certain we solve for a few things. Right now, I worry that the team's work can feel to you like a bunch of cryptic backend changes, and you can't tell if we're on track or not. So I want to make sure incremental progress is much more *visible* to you."/

/"I'm also worried that you're in a tough situation, because of... so I want to be sure you're able to..."/

/"Finally, if I were in your shoes, I would probably be pretty worried about... so I want to be absolutely certain we don't..."/

# XXX For substack: This is where you'll use your hypothesis about their frustrations, fears, delights and dreams.

This is the payoff for the work you've done to mine for underlying emotions.

If they have fears, express how reasonable those fears are, and that whatever you do, they must be addressed. If they have frustrations, validate those frustrations and express your desire to smooth them out as much as possible. If they have unmet desires and dreams, speak authentically to how much those matter.

As with the statement of strategic goals, after you lay those out to your stakeholder, check in with them:

/"Does that sound about right?"/

And again, if they hesitate or offer caveats, draw those out, and then repeat them back.

Why do I recommend spending so much time speaking to your stakeholder's concerns?

You're about to ask your stakeholder to take the risk of changing their behavior. By making clear how deeply you understand and care about *their* concerns, you make that risky step feel much safer. You make it clear that they aren't facing that risk alone.

Which will then make it possible for them to hear *your* concerns.

** Share Your Concerns

Lay out the things *you* need to solve for:

/"I'm worried that the engineers are spending a ton of time responding to urgent support requests for our existing products. Unless we find a way to reduce interruptions, I don't think we're going to see much progress on the <Quux> pipeline this year."/

Express your concerns in a way which doesn't trigger feelings for your stakeholder of being judged or attacked. E.g. don't say, "You're not pushing back enough on the Success team, so the engineers are overwhelmed." Instead, as above, make a statement about the situation you both find yourselves in.

Offer your concerns as challenges you can face together.

** Propose An Adjustment In How You Work Together

Now, pull it all together. Lay out an incremental adjustment which, if possible:

- Makes things a little better for you

- Makes things a little better for your stakeholder

- Moves you /both/ a little closer to your shared long-term goal

Then, invite them to collaborate with you, around your proposed change:

/"I'd like to set up a weekly triage session, and ask the Success team to bring *all* support requests to that. Also, I'll work with the engineers so that, at sprint planning, you have a much clearer understanding of what near-term outcome we're working backward from. That way, you and I can, together, decide when to push back on Success, to be certain we stay on track for the <Quux> project."/

# In the remainder of the chapter, I'll explore each tactic in more detail, bringing many to life with narrative examples.

# It takes time to come up with something crisp, clean and compelling. Talk to some friends about how they've faced similar collaboration challenges at their jobs. Try out new ways to frame your stakeholder's concerns, to find a truly empathetic way to speak to their underlying feelings. Brainstorm the smallest possible adjustment that you could propose, that would still help you just a little bit. Spend time refining and testing your understanding of what your overall business is trying to do, to see if you can find creative new ways to move towards long-term goals.

# Feel free to dip in an out of these, depending on what problems you run into with your very own stakeholder.

** A Catalog Of Challenges And Tactics
# Buffet of Tactics
# A Catalog of Tactics
# An Overview Of Tactics
# An Overview Of Tactics To Be Described Later

This four step approach, although straightforward to describe, can be somewhat tricky to put into practice. I mean, if humans were easy, we'd all be rich.

Therefore, to equip you to work with your very own Important Person, with their very own specific challenges, I'm going to share a sprawling smorgasbord of *tactics*. Which tactics I will organize by *frustrating stakeholder behaviors*.[fn:: Just about every one of which is a *human* behavior. Which is to say I, and you, will tend to demonstrate these exact same behaviors whenever someone asks *us* to change our behavior.]

Stroll through the aisles! See if any particular stakeholder behavior sounds familiar! If so, pull a tactic off the shelf and try it out.

First, I'm going to list the full set in summary form. In later posts, I'll explore each in more detail.

So if you see a specific frustrating behavior, and say, "OMG, *yes*, that's *exactly* my CEO!", but then, to your dismay, the solution seems super unclear, and you say "OMG, *no*, what are you even *saying*, Dan?!?!", then please stay tuned!

Okay, let's go!

-----

# For each tactic, I'll first name a problem you might run into with stakeholders, and then sketch in the corresponding action you could take.

# Below, I'm going to list all the tactics in summary form.

 - Problem: *Your stakeholder is human*, and is thus reluctant to commit to *"permanently"* changing their behavior.

   Solution: *Propose a Timebox*

   Ask your stakeholder to try out a change in their behavior for a *limited period of time*, with, at the end, a built-in review of how it worked *for them*.

   -----

   Problem: *Your stakeholder is human*, and thus, they will resist changing their behavior *because some other human* asked them to.

   Solution: *Offer A Future Decision*

   Ensure that your initial, timeboxed increment of change ends with a *meaningful decision* that your *stakeholder* gets to make. This securely positions them in a *high-status role* where they *retain control*.

   -----

 - Problem: *Truly* improving how you work with your stakeholder requires a *complex adjustment*, one you *can't* implement all at once.

   Solution: *Shrink Your Ask*

   Propose implementing just *a part* of that better way to work, even if that *doesn't* immediately improve things for you. Build *momentum*, and then gradually layer in the other pieces of the solution.

   -----

 - Problem: Your stakeholder doesn't hear your concerns as *valid* or *important*.

   Solution: *Link Frustrations To Outcomes*

   With a friend, conduct a Five Whys to develop a *chain of consequences* that shows how your day-to-day frustrations, if left unchecked, will eventually impact a *strategic outcome* your stakeholder *cares intensely about*.

   -----

 - Problem: The connections from your current frustrations to the strategic outcome feel *abstract and theoretical* to your stakeholder.

   Solution: *Tell A Story Of Growing Danger*

   Use the structure of a specific kind of story to render your concerns *vivid*, *immediate* and *memorable* to your stakeholder.

   -----

 - Problem: Your stakeholder accepts that your frustrations *matter*, but they seem unwilling to do anything *now*.

   Solution: *Create Urgency Through Visibility*

   Make it possible to *see* the underlying problems, so that you can both motivate *immediate action*, and also make it possible to demonstrate *incremental improvements*.

   -----

 - Problem: *Your stakeholder is human*, and thus, a request to change their behavior makes them feel *defensive* and *resistant*.

   # This is especially true if you feel like you have to tell them that their behavior is *frustrating the people around them*. But, good lord, they're being really frustrating.

   Solution: *Invite Your Stakeholder To Solve Your Problems*

   Find a non-judgmental way to describe the *results* of their behavior as a problem for the two of you to *solve together*. Ask them *open-ended questions* that offer them a chance to be *clever* by solving this problem. As part of that, *"play low status"*.

   -----

 - Problem: You can't figure out a way for your adjustment to *quickly* improve things *for your stakeholder*, while also addressing *your* key frustrations.

   Solution: *Find Wins For Your Stakeholder By Hook Or By Crook*

   Find *some wins* for you stakeholder that you *can* offer, even if they're not *actually necessary* for your adjustment.

   -----

 - Problem: You need to ask your stakeholder to *stop doing something*. You're worried that they will resist, because they are *a human being*, and thus *like doing things*.

   Solution: *Keep 'Em Busy*

   Ask your stakeholder to *start* doing something *new*, instead of their existing behavior. Allow them to *channel their energy* into that new thing.

   -----

 - Problem: Your proposed adjustment might raise *concerns* or *fears* for your stakeholder, in which case they will *resist* making a change.

   Solution: *Address Fears Directly*

   In your request for change, first *validate* their fears and then speak *directly* to how your proposed adjustment will address them.

   -----

 - Problem: Your stakeholder is *reluctant* to commit to your proposed adjustment, because, *being human*, they feel like they have to do *all the hard work*.

   Solution: *Put Yourself On the Line*

   Make it easier for your stakeholder to say *yes* by making it clear that you will *personally* take on *extra work*, and/or personally face *some hard thing*.

** The Catalog of Tactics
*** Propose a Timebox

*Problem*

Your stakeholder is human, and is thus reluctant to commit to "permanently" changing their behavior.

*Example*

When you say to your PM, /"During planning, even though I know time feels tight, could you please spend more time sharing context with the engineers?"/...

...they hear this as an open-ended request to change their behavior.

That feels like a risky commitment to make, so their brain whirs up into action, quickly coming up with reasons to say "no": /"we barely have enough time to get through all the tickets already"/; /"it'll take *forever* to share all that context"/; /"that one scary engineer always glares at me when planning runs long"/; etc, etc.

*Solution*

Ask your stakeholder to try out a change in their behavior for a *limited period of time*, and promise to review how it's going at the end.

/"For our *next sprint*, could I ask you to, during planning, spend some time laying out the ‘Why’ behind the epics, before we get into the detailed tickets? After the planning session, we can check in, and if it turns out we ran tight on time, I'll work with you to streamline grooming and pre-planning, before the next one."/

The PM in question may still find this a bit nervous-making to contemplate, but it's being presented as an *experiment*, not a *commitment*, so your odds are much better of getting a "yes." Also, we're mixing in a bit of Address Fears Directly, by speaking to the time pressures.

*** Offer A Future Decision

*Problem*

Your stakeholder is human, and thus, they resist changing their behavior /because someone asked them to/.

*Example*

When you say, /"I want the team go off and spend a month in heads-down exploration, without having to constantly report back on status to you and me as they go."/...

...your stakeholder, who already feels like they're struggling to keep the work on track, hears you asking them to give up even more control! How are they supposed to know what is going on?! Those status check-ins are critical! They push back.

There are, subtly, two things going on here:

 - The new pattern of interaction would *genuinely* remove some touchpoints that allowed them to direct the work in the past.

 - But also, letting *you* dictate how you will work together places your stakeholder in a "lower status" role.

Humans have a powerful cluster of mental wiring around status -- many stakeholders will actively resist taking a "lower status" role, in which you "get to tell them what to do." But... humans *also* have a powerful cluster of mental wiring that works hard to preserve a belief in their own enlightened rationality, no matter how irrational they may actually be.[fn:: Evolution has carefully tuned us for certain kinds of self-deception. I believe it's quite useful to understand this in yourself, if you have a position of authority. Steven Pinker is quite strong on this.]

Thus, your stakeholder's brain will immediately *translate* the second fear into the first, quickly coming up with lots of Perfectly Rational reasons why your idea Just Won't Work... which gives them the pleasant benefit of retaining the higher status role. Arguing *directly* against those ideas is a trap, because what your stakeholder is really doing, without realizing it, is trying to retain the higher status role.

*Solution*

Ensure that your initial, timeboxed increment of change ends with a *meaningful decision that your stakeholder gets to make.* This securely positions them in a high-status place of control.

/"I'd like to ask for the team to do a month of heads-down exploration. At the end of the month, they'll sit down with you and share everything they've learned, so *you* can decide if they’ve found something worth committing to."/

/"During the month, I'd like to let them go fast, without having to report back on status to you and me, so they can produce a really thorough overview at the end of the month. Can we spend some time aligning on what key info you'll want to see at that point, in order to make your decision?"/

Your stakeholder can now express their control and status by first, setting the decision criteria to guide the month's work, and then, at the end of the month, actually Making The Big Decision. Your asked them to change their behavior (no more status check ins), but, by giving them a meaningful decision to make, helped them feel very much in control. By setting the decision criteria, they are still clearly "in charge".

*** Shrink Your Ask

*Problem*

Truly improving how you work with your stakeholder requires a complex adjustment, and you can't see a way to implement it all at once.

*Example*

You're worried that your team is toiling long hours in the feature factory, staying super busy but barely moving the business forward at all. You know you could create hugely more value (and find your job way more fun!) if only:

 - The exec team would set high-level strategy instead of relentlessly obsessing over features

 - The product team would turn that strategy into a series of outcomes instead of writing sprawling project specs

 - The engineers could learn how to collaborate around outcomes instead of just chewing through tickets as fast as possible

That's a genuinely great way to work! I highly recommend it! But good lord, there are so many moving pieces to get right. Trying to change too much at once is a pretty much guaranteed way to fail (I say, from genuine, bitter experience!).

*Solution*

Shrink your ask to implementing just a part of that better way to work, *even if that doesn't immediately improve things for you*.

/"For the next few sprints, can we take the time to be sure the engineers understand a specific outcome each bundle of features is supposed to unlock? I want to challenge the engineers to come up with creative options for achieving outcomes, but I think we need to start by just being certain they even know what those outcomes are."/

If the PM agrees to this, you won't necessarily see much immediate improvement in value creation (the engineers may genuinely have no experience turning outcomes into options, yet). But you'll start to build momentum, and can gradually layer in other pieces of the solution.

*** Link Frustrations To Outcomes

*Problem*

Your stakeholder doesn't seem to hear your concerns as valid or important. They don't understand why "your" problems matter for the business.

*Example*

When you say, /"We need to spend time reviewing our codebase for out of date libraries."/...

... your VP of Product /hears/:

/"Please allow us to miss our next several delivery deadlines so the engineers can do something that you'll never understand, to make things theoretically better in a way you'll never be able to see."/[fn:: Aka, for you old school Far Side fans, "Blah, blah, blah, Ginger, blah, blah, blah."]

That VP of Product is thinking night and day about an ambitious strategic outcome: /Grow top-line revenue by 50% in the next two years./

It's all their CEO ever talks about! They don't have time for theoretical engineering concerns! Launching a new product asap is do or die!

They tell you, brusquely, /"Unfortunately, we don't have time to focus on anything but business priorities right now."/

You seethe. Isn't having a well-architected, reliable, safe system a frickin' business priority?!

*Solution*

With a friend, conduct a Five Whys to develop a *chain of consequences* that shows how your day-to-day frustrations, if left unchecked, will eventually impact a strategic outcome your stakeholder cares intensely about.

Q: /"Why is it a problem for the business to not know if we have out of date libraries?"/

A: /"Because we need to know if any of those libraries contain security vulnerabilities."/

Q: /"Why is it a problem for the business if we don't know if we have libraries with security vulnerabilities?"/

A: /"Because we're trying to prepare for a SOC-2 audit, and we need to show that we're executing our process for keeping our libraries up to date."/

Q: /"Why is it a problem for the business if we can't complete a SOC-2 audit?"/

A: /"Because enterprise customers are demanding we provide them with a SOC-2 report, or they're going to churn."/

Q: /"Why is it a problem for the business if some enterprise customers churn?"/

A: /"Because our strategic outcome is increasing top-line revenue by 50% in the next two years, and enterprise customers are a central part of the plan to get there."/

You need to *connect to the strategic outcome*. That links your immediate concerns to the specific thing your stakeholder is most obsessively worrying about.

*** Tell A Story Of Growing Danger

*Problem*

You've linked your current frustrations to longer-term strategic outcomes... but the connections feel abstract and theoretical to your stakeholder.

# dry and unconvincing.

*Example*

You walk through the chain above, and wrap up with, /"... and that's why we believe we should conduct a thorough library review, if we're serious about the enterprise segment."/

The head of Product nods slowly. Each individual step in your Five Whys chain makes sense. But the whole thing feels a bit... tenuous. It's a bit of reach.

Also, they've *committed* to the CEO to ship a version of the new product by the end of the quarter. And there are a dozen other things that are urgently on fire.

They say, bluffly, /"Maybe we can talk about this, what did you call it, library review after we launch the beta. But I think we need to stay heads down for this quarter."/

And then the VP of Product promptly /forgets about this entire conversation/. It felt to them like "an engineering concern". It presented as kind of abstract. Without fully realizing they've done so, they've mentally tagged it as safe to ignore for now.

*Solution*

Use the structure of a *story of growing danger* to render your concerns vivid, immediate and memorable to your stakeholder.

That particular story arc begins:

The World Is At Peace -> A Danger Emerges -> A Hero Struggles To Face The Danger -> The Danger Intensifies

You say, /"Last week, I caught up with one of the senior sales reps. She told me that, a year ago, when she closed our first enterprise customer, they didn't ask much about security." (world at peace) "But, since then, more and more deals in her pipeline are stalling out, because everyone's getting so worried about data breaches." (danger emerges)/

/"She's tried buying time by promising that we'll have a SOC-2 by early next year. She's managed to close a few deals based on that promise." (struggle to face danger) "But now, because of the pressure to get the beta live, we're running a risk of missing our SOC-2 deadlines altogether. She's *really* worried about going back to those customers if we don't get an audit completed. She told me "there's no way on earth" the sales team will hit plan next year without a clean SOC-2." (danger intensifies)/

Even if your stakeholder doesn't commit to immediately taking action, they're going to *remember* that story in a totally different way than a dry, logical chain. It will feel vivid. It will feel "real".

That structure of a Story of Growing Danger is wired into the human mind (which is why such stories can be found across all cultures). Later, we'll dig into the beats of that story arc, and show other examples of how to apply them.

*** Create Urgency Through Visibility

*Problem*

Your stakeholder accepts that your frustrations matter, but they seem unwilling to do anything *now*.

*Example*

After you tell the above story of growing danger, your VP of Product is clearly *worried*. But they're still fretting over all the other priorities, and you can't seem to get into a concrete conversation about the steps to take, right now.

*Solution*

Create visibility into the early impact of the underlying problems, so that you can both motivate immediate action, *and* to make it possible to see incremental improvement.

/"We've worked with the security team to create a series of *overall milestones* for getting to SOC-2. For the detailed work leading up to the first milestone, we've set up a *burndown* for you to review as we go. We want to devote a bit of time steadily each sprint, but you'll be able to see if we're on track, and how much work remains. If it looks like we're running a risk around our SOC-2 deadlines, you'll know early, and can decide how to balance work between security and the new product."/

/"Also, sales has agreed to start *tagging opportunities* in the Salesforce when security concerns are a potential blocker. They'll be able to run reports across the pipeline to see potential impact on the sales plan."/

Not only does the visibility help with motivation (e.g. the cost of purely focusing on the new product can now be seen in the sales pipeline), but, as importantly, you're offering them a way to see *incremental progress*. Each week, they'll be able to see the burndowns burning down That converts the security work from an abstract, "blank check" investment to a steady forward march.

This is also mixing in Offer a Future Decision, to ensure the VP of Product can stay in control over the amount of time spent on security work.

*** Invite Your Stakeholder To Solve Your Problems

*Problem*

Your stakeholder is human, and thus, your request to change their behavior makes them feel defensive and resistant. This is *especially* true if you feel like you have to tell them that their behavior is frustrating the people around them. But, good lord, they're being so frustrating.

*Example*

After your team shares updates and options with your CEO, they have this habit of holding forth about all the *other* things the team *could* be doing. Then, once everyone is good and totally confused about priorities, the CEO says, sagely, /"It's all execution now."/ Then they stand up and leave the meeting. Everyone stares at each other.

If you say, /"You're confusing everyone by talking about all the other things you're thinking about. Could you maybe... not do that?"/...

...your CEO is, sadly, likely to hear it as a personal attack. In which case their brain will instantly spring to their own defense, confidently telling them: /"You're just sharing context! What, are you supposed to *not* talk openly with your own teams?! Can't you expect engineers to understand a free-flowing discussion!?!?"/

At which point, good luck in getting them to change their behavior.

*Solution*

Find a non-judgmental way to describe the /results/ of their behavior as a problem for the two of you to solve together. Ask them open-ended questions that offer them a chance to cleverly solve this problem. As part of that, play "low status".

/"At the end of our meetings, I'm worried the team is sometimes unclear about what is most valuable or important for the business. I hate to say it, but they sometimes end up spending time on things that don't really matter. They just don't have your depth of understanding about the business as a whole. How can we make sure the team doesn't end up wasting time on things that don't matter?"/

You're asking your CEO to be an expert! But you're pointing their expertise at the very problem they're currently causing -- leaving the team totally confused after the meetings.

If you keep on asking your open-ended question over and over, odds are extremely good that your CEO will come up with the brilliant idea of making sure they end the meeting by clearly stating the top priorities for the team, and clearly stating the things the team *shouldn't* work on. You say "Wow, what a great idea." Your CEO looks forward to trying out "their idea" at the next review meeting.

We'll share more details on how to apply this incredibly useful technique later! Humans are fun! This technique totally works, even if the person kind of knows you're trying to use it![fn:: I say this having personally experienced this!]

*** Find Wins For Your Stakeholder By Hook Or By Crook

*Problem*

You can't figure out a way for your adjustment to immediately improve things for your stakeholder. Try as you might, you don't see a way to address your frustrations that benefits them in the near term.

*Example*

The Head of Customer Success constantly interrupts you to check in on the status of the various troubleshooting tickets their team has submitted. You want them to instead bring all ticket questions to a weekly status/triage meeting. The resulting increase in focus time *will* accelerate delivery of new features that Success has been begging for. But... it will take a while for any one feature to go live.

If you directly ask the Head of Success to change their behavior this way, they might resist, since there's no immediate benefit for them, and they find it genuinely useful to get those quick updates from you. Even if they do try it out, they may perceive it as something they're doing "for you". Because they feel like they're doing you a favor, they continue to directly ping you about "important" tickets. And, it turns out that almost all the Success tickets are important. Who knew?

*Solution*

Find some wins for you stakeholder that you *can* offer... even if they're not strictly necessary for your adjustment.

You've noticed that the Head of Success /loves/ telling stories about customer problems. You think it *feels good* to them, to walk people through some specific challenge a customer is having with the product. Beyond a rational desire to get certain work prioritized, you suspect that makes them feel like they're doing "everything they can" to support their customers. Which you know is a profound motivation for them.

Thus, yYou add to your proposed status/triage meeting a "Customer Story Of The Week". The Head of Success will take a few minutes to tell a full story behind one specific ticket that their team has submitted. You'll bring along one engineer to triage, and the two of you will listen carefully to that story and ask questions.

Now the Head of Success has something to look forward to, and the new meeting feels like it's "for them", as much as for you. They're giving something up, but they're getting something in return.

Note that this addition *isn't* strictly necessary for your purposes -- you'd still get the key increase in focus time without it. But, by finding a win for them, you can get them to buy in much more wholeheartedly.

*** Keep 'Em Busy

*Problem*

You need to ask your stakeholder to stop doing something. You're worried that they will resist, because they are a human being, and thus like doing things.

*Example*

When you say to your product peer, /"Could you please stop bringing detailed design mockups to the brainstorming sessions? It's shutting down any chance of generating new ideas."/...

... your product peer immediately wonders: What am I supposed to do instead? They are going to feel some resistance.

*Solution*

Ask your stakeholder to *start* doing something new, *instead* of their existing behavior. Allow them to channel their energy into that new thing.

/"Could I ask you to, for the next brainstorming session, bring a handful of different super crude mockups, and be ready to talk about the tradeoffs you imagine for each?"/

What a fun request! And it will still completely deliver what you actually need.

Other examples include:

 - "Stop talking during meeting X" -> "Please take notes during meeting X to discuss after"

 - "Stop attending meeting X altogether" -> "We'd like to ask you to attend meeting Y instead"

 - "Stop overruling all the team's decisions" -> "How about if you pick the one or two most important decisions, we can spend time aligning on those"

 - "Stop crapping all over the team during demos" -> "I'd like you to note down any and all concerns so you can discuss them with me, immediately after demo"

 - "Stop trying to personally advocate with the PM for your priorities" -> "Bring your requests to the monthly shared triage meeting for review"

 - "Stop demanding high-stakes engineering commitments to long-term estimates" -> "Ask the teams to demonstrate that they deeply understand the key business outcomes and then make sure they steadily offer options and decisions, as the work unfolds"[fn:: This one is soooooo easy. I will leave the details as an exercise for the reader.]

*** Address Fears Directly

*Problem*

Your proposed adjustment might raise concerns or fears for your stakeholder, such that they resist making a change.

*Example*

To ship a key new product this year, you want to deprioritize Enterprise support, which currently consumes a lot of engineering time. But you know the VP of Sales will worry about retention, if you do so.

You might be tempted to sweep this under the rug, by just focusing on the positive, and avoiding open conflict. But, if you say, /"We're proposing to strongly focus engineering time on the new product, because that's the core of our company strategy"/...

... your VP of Sales will hear an invitation to start /arguing/, since you don't seem to even understand the retention risk this will cause.

*Solution*

In your request for change, first /validate/ their fears and then /address them directly/.

/"We realize that pulling engineering focus away from enterprise accounts runs a risk of frustrating some important customers. We'd like to propose that the account managers identify a small handful of really key customers, and we'll commit to maintaining full engineering support for those. But we also realize this shift will make the AM's jobs harder this year."/

By validating and addressing their fears, you're inviting the VP of Sales to work with you to figure *how* to make this change work, instead of just fighting *against* it.

*** Put Yourself On the Line

*Problem*

You're worried that your stakeholder will be reluctant to commit to your proposed adjustment, because, being human, they will feel like they'll have to do all the hard work.

*Example*

You run an internal platform/ops team, and have just rolled out a self-service tool that allows developers to spin up pre-configured instances. You want to ask the VP of Engineering to use their authority to mandate that all the teams use that tool, instead of directly contacting ops engineers to build custom one-offs.

But... the VPE knows that this will be *frustrating* to their teams. /All/ of the teams are used to getting custom builds, and some may genuinely need things that your pre-configured instances don't provide. If the VPE issues this mandate, they're going to get a flurry of upset Slack messages and emails over the next few weeks, as engineers suddenly hit roadblocks just as they're trying to get something live.

# This feels to them like a lot to ask.

*Solution*

Make it easier for your stakeholder to say yes by making it clear that you will *personally* take on extra work, and/or personally face some hard thing.

If humans see someone putting themselves on the line to face a difficult or risky challenge, they become much more willing to listen to requests from the person to help.[fn:: This is a big part of what we mean when we talk about someone having "moral authority".]

# Whereas, if a human is asked to do something that they perceive as risky or hard, but the person doing the asking doesn't seem to be taking any personal risks, or shouldering any of the new burdens created, that creates resentment and resistance.

In this case, you could say, /"I know this is going to have some shaky moments early on. My team will set up and monitor a dedicated slack channel for any problems. I'm going to personally clear my calendar for the next three weeks, so I can be as responsive as possible during the initial rollout. Also, if it's okay with you, I want to give the team leads my cell number, and encourage them to call or text me if they hit something tricky or time-sensitive. Finally, if it's okay with you, I'd like to lead a Q&A immediately after you announce this change, so I can hear about any concerns or frustrations."/

This makes clear that you are signing up for "unpleasant" parts of the work -- getting called at all hours, bearing the direct brunt of unhappiness from the team, etc.

* Stashed Later Chapters
** Propose a Timebox

Problem: your stakeholder is reluctant to consider a change in their behavior.

Solution: ask your stakeholder to try changing their behavior for an initial, limited period of time.

If your request feels slightly uncomfortable for your stakeholder (as it often will!), it's *much* easier for them to say "yes" if you're asking for a few weeks, than it is to agree to make a change indefinitely.

Usually, you'll want the initial period to end with some kind of "review of how it's been going" (which is a very natural opportunity to Offer A Future Decision).

If you can get a commitment to try something new for this short period of time, you can then work to ensure that, at the end of that initial period, the stakeholder experiences things as going well.

Example:

Louisa is a staff engineer at Hydralitics, a business intelligence platform focused on utility companies. A key part of her job is conducting regular architecture reviews with the teams in her domain. Unfortunately, her CTO, Jameson, has developed a frustrating habit of dropping by those architecture reviews and derailing them with half-baked proposals.[fn:: "Wait, Dan, I just remembered: *you've* been a CTO. Did your directs ask you to stop talking at architecture reviews at some point?" Um... maybe we should just move on.] Jameson always starts by saying, "Is it okay if I ask a question?" But somehow all his "questions" end up turning into thinly veiled suggestions, pretty much all of which are useless thanks to key bits of technical reality he doesn't fully understand. If Louisa hears him say "I don't know, but it seems to me like we could..." one more time, she is going to scream. His interruptions are undercutting her authority, eating up time in the meetings, *and* sending the teams down a succession of blind alleys. Her partner is starting to finish her Jameson-related sentences at dinner, "I know, Louisa, Jameson is smart, but Jameson just doesn't know what he's talking about in your area, Jameson should maybe learn to shut up sometimes. And could that maybe be the last Jameson thing for tonight? Pretty please?"

When Louisa has a minute to think, she tries to imagine saying: "Jameson, please stop talking during architecture reviews." Or, even: "Jameson, please stop coming to the reviews." But she gets an immediate pit in her stomach. Those feel like uncomfortably aggressive demands.

# Xxx Name her friend

She's stuck for a while, just getting more and more frustrated. But then, one night, she's talking out life with a friend over beers, and discovers that her friend is something of a master of the ju-jitsu of stakeholder management. That friend pushes her to think about asking for a brief, timeboxed change, instead of some intimidatingly permanent shift. She also suggests that Louisa think about Jameson *likes* about attending the architecture reviews.

Louisa feels oddly charged up on her walk home. Somehow the license to ask for a limited change feels very freeing. And, with her mind now working away, she starts getting ideas about how to speak to Jameson's underlying feelings (as her partner well knows, Louisa has spent plenty of time analyzing All Things Jameson).

# Xxx Maybe list what she knows, first

# about both Jameson's concerns, and also what things he really enjoys. "You know," Louisa says to her friend, "I'll bet part of it is that he likes seeing the team at work. He's really good at that, if I'm going to be honest. He just picks up on, like, all these little things." Her friend toasts her with her pint glass. "And there you go."

The next day, she grabs a bit of time with her CTO. After some initial chitchat, she takes a deep breath and says, "I'd like to ask if we can try out something new for tomorrow's arch review. First off, I want to make sure you can stay on top of how the architecture is evolving, *and* I want you to be certain that you get to see the team at work. My sense is that it's super valuable for you to *see* who on the tech track is really stepping up. So I think it's really good that you're there."

Jameson nods, and it's clear to Louisa her guess was right: one of the things Jameson really likes is being able to get a window into the performance of the senior and staff engineer cohort. She continues.

"But, unfortunately, sometimes, when you ask questions, I think the team gets confused. They're not sure if you're just trying to fill in your own understanding, or if you're telling them your decision, or if you're asking them to go off and explore something. I'm struggling a bit to keep everyone on track. Both during the meetings, but also afterwards."

"For tomorrow's session, if you're okay with it, I'll ask you to listen and take notes, but to not speak up during the actual discussions. I'll meet with you 1:1, immediately after, to dig into any questions you have, and to get your feedback on both the team and the architecture. We can also talk then about if that feels like a useful pattern for future reviews, or if we'd want to tweak it."

Jameson thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "I can try that for tomorrow, sure. I might want to have one of the directors also stay to talk about the team, but we can wait and see how it goes. Do you want me to, like, say absolutely nothing? Or just not talk as much?"

He seems genuinely open, so Louisa says, "For tomorrow, I'd love to try having you say absolutely nothing."

"Can do," says Jameson. And they move on to other topics.

To Louisa's pleasant surprise, it didn't feel hard to make her request. Instead of making a demand, she was offering Jameson a sort of shared experiment, to enter into together. And the, adjusting the details together felt like a nice bit of working together.

Other tactics she used:

 - Put Yourself On the Line: she personally committed to spending extra time with him after the session.

 - Keep 'Em Busy: instead of just asking Jameson to stop talking, she asked him to do something specific instead -- take notes so he can give feedback on the team and the architecture.

 - Find Wins For Your Stakeholder By Hook Or By Crook: even though it wasn't strictly necessary for her own needs, she created a new opportunity for Jameson to discuss team performance, which she knows he finds both valuable and meaningful.

** Offer A Future Decision

Problem: Your stakeholder is a human being. Therefore, agreeing to change their behavior /because someone asked them to/ makes them feel like they're losing control.

Solution: Ensure that your initial, timeboxed increment of change ends with a decision that your stakeholder gets to make, so they still feel in control over the process.

That will help them feel in control, which makes it much easier for them to say yes.

Example

Jonas is a product manager at BoardedUp, a board game subscription service. He is, unfortunately, struggling with his engineering peer Lizabet, the engineering manager and tech lead for their team. Lizabet won't let her engineers start any work, until Jonas first writes /extremely/ detailed tickets. She wants every ticket to contain enough information that any engineer on the team could pick up any ticket and fully deliver it, without having to "slow down" to ask Jonas questions. Lizabet insists this is necessary to avoid wasting the team's time, and also says the it will make them extremely efficient. However, Jonas has worked on teams where the engineers and PM's wrote much more informal tickets, then talked to each other steadily throughout the sprints, and it felt like things went much faster.[fn:: 100% of the highest-performing teams I've been on and/or witnessed all talked to each other a *ton*. Just about all of them leaned on pretty lightweight ticket-writing as part of that.]

Jonas goes through the various steps we've laid out, and comes up with a proposed adjustment. The core change will be for Jonas to run sprint planning with much lighter, shorter tickets. He will spend planning discussing some of the nuances of those tickets with the whole team, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding. Then, throughout the sprint, Jonas will commit to being available at the drop of a hat to answer any and all engineering questions. Finally, as an extra win, he proposes a carve out of time to improve the team's deploy scripts, a long-standing engineer frustration.

But, even with all of that planned out, he's still worried about approaching Lizabet with his request.

She's fairly new as a manager, and he knows she feels concerned about her authority with the team (some of who have been professional programmers since she was in high school). He's worried that she's put some kind of a stake in the ground about this way of working.

After talking it over with his manager, he decides to really focus on this as a temporary experiment, and one where *Lizabet* will get to decide whether or not it's working. He decides to close his pitch to her by saying, "You and I would meet immediately after sprint demo.[fn:: Why not after retro? Jonas and Lizabet's team has fallen out of the habit of doing a regular sprint retro. That should likely be the next thing for him to work on.] I'll want to hear from you how this change has been working for the team, and if there's anything whatsoever that's been difficult about it. I can share how it's been working on my end. At that point, you can make the call on whether or not to stick with this new way of working. If it seems like there's something good in it, you and I could decide on any adjustments. Most of all, I want to be certain both you and the engineers don't end up feeling like we're wasting their time."

Given this clear signaling that she'll retain control, Lizabet proves willing to try this experiment for a sprint. She does ask that any ticket touching the database schema get *some* extra details, which Jonas is happy to agree to. They pitch the change to the team together, and Jonas can see that both Lizabet and her engineers are a little excited by shaking things up.

** Shrink Your Ask

Problem: Truly improving how you work together requires a complex adjustment, and you can't see a way to implement it all at once.

Solution: Shrink your ask to implementing just a part of that better way to work, even if that doesn't immediately improve things for you.

If you can draw your stakeholder into steady collaborative improvements, you can then layer in the other pieces of the puzzle.

Example:

Oliver is an engineering director at Rugger, a leading online purveyor of artificial grass and turf. Oliver leads a handful of teams who maintain his company's backend fulfillment systems. This quarter, he's working with his product peer, Alicia, to integrate their systems with a partner who builds and maintains fields for college athletic departments. Once that integration work is done, his company will be able to offer colleges packaged purchase, delivery and install services, which should unlock a significant boost in revenue.

Unfortunately, Oliver feels like his team is barely making any progress, because they're completely swamped with support requests from the warehousing and shipping teams who depend on the existing systems.

There's no simple fix. They can't just abandon their existing users (the resulting customer complaints have a way of getting back to the CEO). They also can't just hit an indefinite pause on the integration work---half the company's revenue forecasts seem to count on it.

Fortunately, Oliver does have an idea he thinks could really help. He wants to put in place a new, much more visible triage process for warehousing and shipping issues. He believes doing so will create two benefits:

 - First, he'll be able to force explicit tradeoffs between handling current issues and building the new integration

   Currently, the engineers are sort of vaguely expected to just get it all done, aka make their own, local decisions about how to spend their time.

 - Second, he can identify where they can make the highest leverage fixes

He strongly suspects there are a couple of places in their legacy systems that are responsible for most of the issues. But he doesn't know which parts, and so he can't make a case to Alicia other than "We should fix our legacy systems", which is a total non-starter. If they can centralize bug handling through a triage process, he has at least a shot at seeing patterns he can then act on.

Unfortunately, to see these benefits, he'd have to put in place *multiple* changes:

 - He'd have to persuade Alicia to spend political capital to push the ops teams into this new triage process

 - They'd have to figure out who, exactly, does the key triage decision-making. Alicia *doesn't* do this right now, and isn't going to be super excited about taking it on.

 - Oliver will have to figure out how to link ops team-reported issues to the code that caused each problem (often far upstream of the reported issue)

 - He and Alicia will then need to carve out time to fix those underlying problems.

Until all that happens, he's not going to see any speed ups in delivery velocity, nor much improvement in engineer focus time.

After a few weeks of feeling stuck, he decides to just get started with something small, to try to build some momentum towards what he ultimately thinks they need.

He asks Alicia to join him in a new, weekly thirty minute meeting with his three engineering leads. He asks each lead to bring to that meeting:

 - A rough estimate of how much time their engineers spend dealing with ops team issues that week

 - The top two or three "themes" of those issues

That's it. They can get going with that right away. It's a very modest ask of Alicia.

Note: this won't free up any time---in fact, it means his tech leads have to do something new. But it is a meaningful first step towards setting up that triage process. It builds alignment with Alicia on the value of reducing time spent on issues, because she can now *see* just how much time the engineers are spending. It should also show her and Oliver some options for reducing that time. If they can identify a small number of themes which drive most of the issues, they can make a targeted technical investment to clean up those underlying problems.

It gets Oliver closer to the triage meeting he ultimately wants. To get all the way there, he could gradually expand on that initial thirty minute meeting, layering in the other parts of how he thinks the triage could/should work.

This tactic pairs well with both Propose a Timebox, and Create Urgency Through Visibility (in the above, Oliver is creating a form of visibility).

** Link Frustrations To Outcomes

Problem: Your stakeholder doesn't seem to hear your concerns as valid or important. They don't understand why "your" problems matter for the business.

Solution: Go through a Five Whys to develop a chain of consequences that shows how your day-to-day frustrations, if left unchecked, will eventually impact your company's long-term goals.

The Five Whys process, famously associated with Toyota[fn:: A company profoundly worthy of study.], simply means asking "Why?" over and over again, to probe deeply beneath the surface of some challenge or problem.

Below, I'll provide a detailed example of how to use this technique to connect your immediate concerns to long-term business outcomes.

However, before we dive into that, we have to first decide: who are you asking your "Whys" *of*?

My recommendation is to start by asking *yourself*. Use this to build your own mental model. Perhaps then continue with a trusted friend.

In general, I *don't* recommend asking a relentless series of "Whys" of your stakeholder. Why not? Unfortunately, many stakeholders find this kind of rigorous probing, *well*, frustrating. They can get defensive, and resent having to "explain themselves."[fn:: E.g. Louis CK does a brilliant riff in Hilarious on how it feels to be on the receiving end of a Five Whys, in the context of parenting young children, not of running a business, but it's surprisingly similar?] That said, if your tactical empathy skills are strong, and your stakeholder welcomes rigor in your collective thinking, go for it! Otherwise, I recommend going through the cycle of repeated "Whys" on your own. Doing so will usually generate some specific questions for you to take to your stakeholder, to fill in missing parts of your picture of the business. You can ask them those more specific questions, instead of the blunt series of Whys.

Here's how you can use the Five Whys.

Name the immediate frustration you're experiencing.

Ask, "Why is this a problem for the business?"

Then, whatever answer you come up with, ask that same "Why" question again.

Keep doing that, over and over, until you eventually arrive at the strategic intent you've extracted from your stakeholder. If you can't get to the strategic intent, talk to some people, keep refining your understanding of the business. You may even end up realizing that your current frustrations *aren't* related to achieving that strategic intent, no matter how hard you look (this isn't bad! It will let you focus your advocacy on things that do matter!).

# That chain should not only show the importance of dealing with your frustrations, it should also help identify some leading indicators, which you can then target for creating visibility.

Example:

Sagar works as an engineer at InfinitePool, a B2B company that sells applicant tracking systems to talent departments at large enterprises. Sagar is the tech lead on a sprint team that owns the hiring manager experience within the overall product. Unfortunately, Sagar suffers from the misfortune of being both experienced and nice. As a result, InfinitePool's sales reps just /relentlessly/ pester Sagar with feature requests. When a sales rep doesn't get an immediate response, they ping Sagar over and over in Slack to "check for status". Last month, at the company party, Sagar saw Jordy, a sales rep, striding towards him with a big grin on his face, and Sagar had to fight an overwhelming desire to run away.

#  Each sales rep claims that their own large, opinionated customer will churn if they don't get their feature, right away.
# , Out of fear that Jordy would try to browbeat him into working on Jordy's pet feature.[fn:: He was right.]

Sagar has been trying to get his product manager, Emily, to step in and wrangle the sales team, but, so far, she's been unwilling to do so. Sagar has to admit that Emily has plenty to do to organize the work the team is *supposed* to be doing. Furthermore, these feature requests (of course) come in as "bugs", and Emily genuinely doesn't have time to review every single bug report. But neither does Sagar! He and his team are getting more and more miserable, having to spend every day fending off angry requests they can't possibly satisfy.

Sagar *has* managed to extract a meaningful strategic intent from Emily: within the next eighteen to twenty-four months, InfinitePool needs a new product to sell to enterprise talent departments, in order to keep growing revenue. The current best bet is to find a way to help companies handle the overwhelming tidal wave of resumes that pour in, now that AI assistance has spread through the applicant pool.[fn:: The sharp-eyed among you will recognize that, in this moment, our story has taken something of an abrupt turn to aspirational fantasy! I would /love/ to tell you that most companies set strategic product goals around *customer problems* instead of *cool-sounding products*, but that has not been my experience! I'm sure such companies exist, but they are hella rare! We'll explore this in more depth in the "We Need a New Product ASAP!" case study.]

Sagar wants to make his case to Emily one more time, but he's worried it's going to sound like he's just bitching about doing maintenance. And their day-to-day work is so far removed from that long-term goal, all he can come up with is, "The engineers are getting pissed." Which doesn't sound compelling, even to him. That sounds like a problem for /Sagar/, not for /InfinitePool/.

Then, one day, on a break in the office kitchen, Sagar runs into his friend Anamika, who leads the job listings ingest team. Anamika hears him out, and then suggests he does a Five Whys.

"A what what?" asks Sagar, grabbing a bag of salted almonds from the snack wall.

"A Five Whys. Look, we can do it right now. What's the thing that's frustrating you, again?"

"What I just said. The sales reps keep interrupting me with 'urgent' feature requests." Sagar makes bitter air quotes with his fingers.

Anamika casually waves that aside, "Okay, why is it a problem for the business that the sales team keeps interrupting you with 'urgent' feature requests?"

That's easy, thinks Sagar. "Because it's *distracting* me. *And* the other engineers." He pops an almond into his mouth.

"Why is it a problem for the business that you and the other engineers are distracted?"

What kind of question is that? Being distracted is, just bad in and of itself, right? Sagar chews on his almond, relishing the sharp tang of salt. Why is it bad for the /business/, not just for him and his team? Oh, wait, that's actually easy, too. "Because the team as a whole isn't moving as *quickly* as we could be."

Before Sagar can feel satisfied for even a moment, Anamika nods and asks again: "Why is it a problem for the business that the team isn't moving as fast as it could be?"

Sagar wants to say, "because we're falling behind our sprint goals", but he knows Anamika will just ask him why again. So he tries instead to think about what Emily is working backwards from. Luckily, she often takes a few minutes during sprint planning to share the whys behind what they're building. Sagar says to Anamika, "Because it's pushing out the delivery of the early prototypes we're trying to build."

"Mmm-hmmm," says Anamika, brushing a strand of hair out of her face. "Why is it a problem for the business if it takes a little longer to build those prototypes?"

Sagar is finding himself slowing down. It's like he's having to imagine the overall business around him as a sort of machine, working towards some outcome. Finally, he says, deliberately, "I... think it's because the ProdDev teams need to test prototypes with customers, as soon as possible. And I think we need to do that to, like, identify a /specific/ product we could build that might solve the resume overload problem for our customers."

Anamika quirks her head to one side. "Why is it a problem for the business if it takes a little longer to identify one specific product opportunity for solving resume overload?"

Sagar feels a spike of excitement as he realizes he's just about made it to the strategic outcome that Emily told him the exec team won't stop talking about. He says to Anamika, "InfinitePool needs to develop a new product to sell, and before we can commit multiple teams to development, we need to identify one specific product opportunity that could potentially solve resume overload."

Anamika asks, one final time, "Why is it a problem for InfinitePool if it has to wait a little longer to start selling a new product?"

With an odd feeling of satisfaction, Sagar says, "Because top-line revenue growth has stalled, and we need to show more growth by our next funding round, which is only eighteen to twenty-four months out. And we believe we can only show more growth if the sales team has something new to sell." He sits back.

"And there you go," says Anamika.

With that end-to-end understanding clear in his mind, Sagar realizes he can *authentically* explain how a reduction in the frequency of interruptive requests from the sales team can, in a small but real way, increase the odds of the company achieving its long-term goals. And, conversely, he can show how every week they *don't* fix that broken pattern, they're slowly drifting further behind.

Having all those specific steps gives him much more clear ammunition than just a vague sense that the engineers are unhappy.

That chain of consequences also allows Sagar to define *leading indicators*: near-term outcomes that his team can only achieve if they get the sales reps to stop blowing up his focus. In this case, that's delivery of early prototypes. Having some options for leading indicators sets him up to use the Create Urgency Through Visibility tactic, and wrap that up in Tell A Story Of Growing Danger.

Finally, by having made the connection to the exec team's highest priority, he realizes he can approach Emily with ideas for how the two of them can approach their shared stakeholders, *together*. This isn't actually Emily's problem, he realizes, it's the VP of Sales's problem. That VP wants a new product for her team, absolutely as soon as possible. And she is also the only force on earth who can stop her reps from bending the rules to keep their own customers happy.

Sagar's mind is whirring with possibilities.

** Tell A Story Of Growing Danger

Problem: You've worked out a way to connect your current frustrations to longer-term strategic outcomes, but the connections feel dry and unconvincing.

Solution: Use the structure of a *story* to render your concerns vivid, immediate and memorable to your stakeholder.

Thanks to several million years of work by evolution, human beings have certain storytelling structures wired deeply into our minds. If you can frame a request using one of those structures, you can take advantage of that wiring to bring your concerns vividly to life.

There's one story structure which I have found particularly useful for sharing business challenges. That structure is "A Story of Growing Danger". Such a story can use steps of a heroic arc, ala:

 - The world is at peace

 - A danger emerges that threatens that peace

 - A hero tries to face the danger, struggles, and fails

 - The danger intensifies

 - The hero discovers new strength within themselves

   (Often with the help of a friend or mentor)

 - The hero overcomes the danger and creates a better world

Now, you may well be saying to yourself, "Um, Dan, what on earth are you talking about? Do you have some kind of obsession with empowerment fantasies?[fn:: I mean, *yes*, obviously.] We're talking about running a business here. I need help with hitting my OKR's, I don't need to hear your random mutterings about heroic journeys."

Of course, of course. But just stick with me for a moment, and let's see if we can bring this to life.

Example

Ted is an engineering director at MediMates, a tech-enabled online pharmacy. Ted's teams own the systems supporting back-end pharmacy operations: prescription review, safety checks, labeling and shipping.

Early in MediMates's history, those operational systems were thrown together to support a handful of pharmacists, serving a few hundred patients in total. Today, Medimates employs nearly one hundred pharmacists, and fills prescriptions for over twenty thousand patients. The backend systems are really struggling to meet current needs. Ted desperately wants to hit pause on delivery of new features, so that he and his team can clean up some particularly nasty legacy bits.

# In particular, he's unhappy about the number of high-impact, time-sensitive exceptions that his team has to fix by hand.

Unfortunately, Ted has been facing a major challenge in getting, well, any time on their roadmap whatsoever. His main stakeholder is the VP of Pharmacy Operations, Amitai. When MediMates's CEO hired Amitai six months ago, he handed him a set of extremely ambitious targets around both scale and efficiency. Amitai spent his first few weeks drafting a fifty-six page PowerPoint deck, detailing a sprawling list of features.[fn:: Why yes, Amitai *did* work for McKinsey earlier in his career, funny that you ask.] All they ever seem to do is move through that deck, one feature at a time.

Ted has been feeling *very* stuck for a while.

# The engineers on his team are looking at him in desperation. Every planning session where they can't seem to carve out any time away from new features makes him feel powerless and frustrated.

Luckily, Ted's boss, Kelsey, has helped him go through the kind of work we've been describing. Ted has learned that MediMates's key long-term strategic goal is to enable same-day delivery of prescriptions. That's what their near-term targets around scale (aka, pharmacist count) and efficiency (aka, mean-time-to-fill) are ultimately driving towards.

With Kelsey's help, he went through a Five Whys, and identified a specific, visible business risk of their legacy systems: his engineers are spending a *crazy* amount of time scrambling around fixing urgent exceptions reported by the pharmacist team.

# He's done the Five Whys (Link Your Frustrations To Outcomes), and can therefore point at a specific issue from the legacy systems that, if left unchecked, will ultimately make it impossible for them to achieve that goal: thanks to both the limitations and the instability of the legacy systems, the engineers are spending a *lot* of time fixing high-impact, time-sensitive exceptions from the pharmacists who use their systems.

# Given the above, how could Ted frame his concerns to Amitai?

# What might you say, if you were in Ted's shoes?

Excited to be able to speak to business outcomes, Ted sits down with Amitai before their next team planning session. "I know how important it is to scale up our pharmacist count, and to keep taking time out of our mean-time-to-fill. But, if we're going to hit our long-term goal of same-day delivery, I think we should pause feature delivery so my teams can reduce the rate of exceptions they have to hand fix." He feels proud about how clearly he made his case.

# What Ted has just tried is an *appeal to reason*.

This is not bad! Ted has demonstrated an empathetic understanding of Amitai's near-term goals (around pharmacist count and time-to-fill). He's named the shared strategic goal of enabling same-day delivery. He's focused his request for technical investment on the visible outcome of reducing the exception rate (instead of a vaguely moralizing demand to clean up technical debt). Heck, now that I write all that out, this is a really excellent request!

Unfortunately, it doesn't work.

Amitai looks across the table in the little conference room and says with a shrug, "That does sound pretty annoying. But right now, we need to stay focused on integrating the new shrink wrapper. We can talk about this exception count problem later."

And then, as Amitai walks out of the meeting, *he promptly forgets about this entire conversation*.

What? Why?

Literally all Amitai hears all day is a parade of complaints from people, each accompanied by a plea for him to deploy his political capital to do something that will piss off some other people and/or his boss. Nothing about this particular request lodges more firmly into his mind.

After Amitai leaves, Ted sits there, feeling more stuck than ever. He's certain that the exception count issues aren't just *annoying*, they're a serious risk for the business. But he can't seem to break through to Amitai.

That weekend, on the sidelines of an ultimate frisbee game, Ted complains about this to a friend on his team who writes and directs plays.[fn:: Just a random such frisbee-playing, theater-devising friend, not resembling anyone writing this book.] That friend, um, *Dean*, lays out the idea of telling a story of growing danger.

At first, Ted can't see how to apply it. Dean says, pointing at Ted with the frisbee he's holding, "Start by finding a *moment in time*, when the danger first emerged. Things were going well, but then some Bad Thing started to develop." Dean waves the frisbee grandly. "Like distant thunder rumbling on the horizon. See if you can find a specific moment. Maybe when something changed, or maybe when you made a worrisome discovery." He waves the frisbee back at Ted. "When might that be?"

"I... dunno? Hang on a sec," Ted says slowly, "I could maybe do something about when I got switched to backend from customer-facing. Actually," he continues, "that *is* when I realized how bad things were. I mean back on Storefront--"

"Now," continues Dean, "hone in on the *moment* of realization. Bring it to life. Then, once that moment is clear, move forward in time. You tried something, you struggled against this rising tide of danger. You all tried *something*, right?"

"So many things. We added logging, and--"

"Don't tell *me* this, tell your guy. And then tell him how, despite your noble efforts, things kept getting worse and worse. And now it's almost too late! If he doesn't do your, whatever it is you want him to do, things are going to go completely to hell, the forces of chaos will win. Your guy, whatshisname---"

"Amitai."

"---Amitai will care. He'll be willing to talk. And he'll *remember*." With that, Dean stands up, stretches, and jogs onto the frisbee field, leaving Ted alone with his thoughts.

Over the next few days, Ted works on his story pitch, even calling up Dean for some practice. It's a lot of time, but it feels worth it. He's really worried that, if he *can't* get buy in from Amitai to do something other than churn out new features, they're going to be backed into a corner that he's not sure how they'll get out of.

Finally, he's ready. At his next weekly meeting with Amitai, he lays out his request in a new way.

"I don't think I ever told you, but I only came over to the backend ops side at around the time you were hired. As I was getting to know my new teams, I sat in on a series of planning sessions. And as I did... I started to notice this weird pattern. I couldn't understand it at first." Ted notices that Amitai is leaning very slightly forward. He's started to get drawn into this moment in time that, as per Dean's advice, Ted has brought to life.

"At every single sprint planning," Ted continues, "the teams would name an engineer to 'Criticals'. I didn't know what that meant, but that engineer always looked *miserable*. Finally, after a few meetings, I stopped everyone and asked what was going on. It turned out that the teams were handling *so many exceptions*, that one engineer from every team had to spend *their entire sprint* doing nothing but cleaning up critical data issues for the pharmacists. That engineer couldn't work on new features, they couldn't improve the code, they would just try to keep prescriptions flowing." Amitai looks worried. Then, as per Dean's advice, Ted twists the knife. "More than once, we've come terrifyingly close to letting prescription conflicts creep in." A look of horror flickers across Amitai's face. All of MediMates is hugely afraid of shipping patients medications with dangerous, even possibly deadly, interactions.

"We've tried to fix some underlying issues, but just staying on top of the existing criticals is taking so much time, that we're barely treading water. I'm worried that, as we scale up our pharmacist count, we're going to be generating more and more exceptions, and more and more engineering time will be devoted to just keeping things from falling over. I want to reduce time-to-fill, and I want to get us to same-day, but, unless we get a handle on critical exceptions, I just don't think we're going to be able to."

He sits back. There's a long pause. Finally, Amitai says, slowly, "Okay, what are some options?"

Just as Dean had predicted.

Ted and Amitai dive into the possibilities, and come up with some initial visibility investments that will get them started (see, Create Urgency Through Visibility).

As he walks back to his desk, Ted can't wait to tell his team that they're finally going to be facing their problems head on.

Now, in the above, we saw Ted telling a full story to Amitai. However, even if you don't have that much time, you can get a great deal of value by using story beats in a concise form.

For example, here was how Ted first laid out his concern, in purely rational form:

"I know how important it is to scale up our pharmacist count, and to keep taking time out of our mean-time-to-fill. But, if we're going to hit our long-term goal of same-day delivery, I think we should pause feature delivery so my teams can reduce the rate of exceptions they have to hand fix."

He could take advantage of the basics of the Story of Growing Danger, and still keep it short, by saying:

"I know how important it is to scale up our pharmacist count, and to keep taking time out of our mean-time-to-fill. Unfortunately, as we've been adding more pharmacists, the engineers are spending more and more time hand-fixing data in production just to keep those pharmacists working. Just last week, we caught a prescription conflict at the last minute. We've tried to fix some underlying issues, but just staying on top of the existing criticals is taking so much time, that we're barely treading water. If we're going to hit our long-term goal of same-day delivery, I think we need to do something to get a handle on these critical exceptions."

Notice how, in the second, there's a subtle flow of time, where the danger keeps getting worse, and the team's noble efforts keep proving not enough.

One of the most powerful things about story structures is how they get lodged in the human mind. Even if you don't get immediate buy-in, using this framing will ensure your stakeholder *remembers* the concern. Daniel Kahneman, in Thinking Fast & Slow, states this as a fundamental finding of psychology research. [clean this up, add a quote, maybe also do Kahneman's thing of saying "This is why I've filled this book with stories"]

** Create Urgency Through Visibility

Problem: Your stakeholder accepts that your frustrations matter, but they seem unwilling to do anything *now*.

Solution: Create visibility into the early impact of the underlying problems, so that you can both motivate immediate action, *and* make it possible to see incremental improvement.

Example:

Dylan is a senior engineer working at Merchandize, a SaaS business that helps ecommerce companies manage art assets for the items they sell. Dylan works on a team that maintains Merchandize's data pipeline, which, every night, does a bulk ingestion of product data from every customer. Of late, Dylan has been growing more and more worried about how that pipeline will handle the increasing load as Merchandize's customer base grows.

# And as they acquire customers with very large portfolios of products.

His team lead, Thomson, cheerfully agrees that the current pipeline is pretty hairy and will need some reworking at some point. Unfortunately, Thomson keeps on telling Dylan that that point is Not Yet. Earlier this quarter, their team was handed an OKR to plumb product dimensions through the pipeline, and product dimensions is all Thomson seems willing to talk about.

Dylan gets more and more worried.

One afternoon, he prepares a long, ranting email for Thomson, about how the top-down OKR's are willfully ignoring the existence of tech debt. The next morning, prior to hitting send, he re-reads the email one last time, and discovers to his dismay that it sounds shrill and whiny. He decides, regretfully, to leave it unsent.[fn:: Over the next few days, Dylan re-reads his rant and hears, in his mind, someone delivering it in rousing tones, and that makes him feel briefly better.] Dylan starts to spend time in the evenings trawling through random ingestion logs, he's not even fully sure why.

Then, one night, he makes a discovery deep in the Job-Errors_NonCrit2 log.

Although no one specifically intended it, Dylan realizes that there's an exception that gets recorded in the logs, every time a nightly job successfully finishes for a customer. And those exceptions, of course, *have a timestamp*. He excitedly downloads a set of logs from six months ago, and finds the same exceptions.

Over the next few nights, Dylan hacks together some scripts to parse and sum this data from the error logs. He glues in data from their main customer database to identify a few outlier large customers. He renders the results in a series of graphs, then adjusts the layout until those graphs tell a clear story.

At his next 1:1 with Thomson, Dylan asks, casually, "Can I show you something I've been working on?"

When Thomson nods, Dylan, with a flourish, unveils his new graphs.

"What am I looking at?" says Thomson, leaning forward to peer at the screen.

"This line," Dylan says, gesturing with the mouse pointer, "is the p95 finish times for our largest customer's nightly jobs, over the last six months. And a forecast for the next three."

"What's the left axis--- Wait, *what*?"

Thomson has just realized that the current finish times are incredibly close to the start of their customer's business days. And, in the forecast, they sail right past that critical moment, and drift into the early afternoon. From painful past experience, both engineers know this is a Very Bad Thing for Merchandize. When their customers lose a day of site sales because they can't link up art assets to recently added products, they get super pissed.

Thomson emerges from that meeting ready to talk to both his product peer and his boss about carving out some time to dig into what, exactly, is causing imports for large customers to run so late.

A key nuance: Thomson is willing to do this work both because he can see the risks of waiting, but also because he will be able to see the result of incremental improvements. If they can do a little bit of work and buy themselves a bit of time, that's a real win, which will be visible on Dylan's new graphs, to both Thomson *and* his stakeholders. Going from a monolithic "We have to fix this giant mess", to "If we make things a little better, we can see a small improvement" is transformative for these kinds of conversations. Even if you don't yet know what the small fix will be.

Creating visibility to motivate action is useful in an extremely wide variety of contexts, not just ones where precise measurements are available.

Is your team constantly stuck waiting on dependencies? Create visibility by regularly estimating how much time each work stream spends in a wait state, and therefore how much overall time is being added to each project. Are such estimates precisely accurate? Of course not. Can even quite rough estimates improve the decisions you and your stakeholders make about whether or not to invest in reducing dependency wait times? Absolutely.[fn:: By the way, if you are struggling with dependency challenges, don't fall into the trap of focusing on how much time each engineer is spending waiting. The problem isn't that your engineers can't staying busy, it's that the work isn't advancing. Sayeth Don Reinertsen: Watch the work product, not the worker.]

Is your team somehow failing to carve out time to do some early technical exploration as a first step in a large project? Create a list of questions you want to develop answers for, and then march through that list of questions, checking them off as you go. That's a useful way to make your incremental learning progress visible, enabling tradeoffs, early exits, etc.

Is your CEO's desire to sit in on all customer interviews stalling out the product team's ability to learn? Start tracking the number of customer interviews each week, and make this friction clear.

Creating visibility is one of my very favorite tactics. It pairs beautifully with Link Your Frustrations To Goals, with Shrink Your Ask, with Propose a Timebox, with Tell a Story of Growing Danger.

Ultimately, I believe the act of creating visibility is so profoundly helpful for getting unstuck because it enables you and your stakeholder to literally *see* the world in the same way. Which can be a deeply meaningful way to bring you together.

# Use an example around security
** Invite Your Stakeholder To Solve Your Problems

Problem: You need to ask your stakeholder to change their behavior, but doing so could make them feel attacked, in which case they may angrily resist.

Solution: Find a non-judgmental way to describe the results of their behavior as a problem for the two of you to solve together. Ask them open-ended questions that offer them a chance to be an expert, and solve the problem you're laying out to them.

This is a form of what Chris Voss calls Calibrated Questions, in Never Split the Difference. And if it works with terrorists, maybe it'll work with your boss!

Example

Lisa is a Product Manager at Doggo, an ecommerce company that specializes in high-end pet food. Lisa works on the Operational Product team, and her team owns the tools that support warehousing and fulfillment. Lisa's key operational stakeholder is the VP of Warehousing, Mark Blevins. He was an early hire, and is something of a legend at Doggo.

# Boondoggle, BoonDoggie

The Good News: Mark Blevins has worked in warehousing for almost two decades, and Mark Blevins knows his shit.

The Bad News: Mark Blevins has worked in warehousing for almost two decades, and Mark Belvins has zero patience with anyone asking him any questions whatsoever.

One Thursday, Mark calls Lisa as she's getting ready to head home. He demands that she drop everything and commit her team to "fixing" a key warehouse workflow, asap. When she tries to ask about what metrics he's worried about, Mark cuts her off and says "Look, I don't need all that crap. If I'm telling you that you have to fix receiving, then you have to fix receiving. Okay?" And then hangs up.

Lisa sits staring at her desk, her phone still in her hand.

She doesn't know what to do with someone who takes a request for business metrics as a personal affront. She *wants* to solve problems with Mark, but if she can't get him to give her some basic operational metrics, how is she going to do her job? She has to make prioritization decisions, she has to set goals for her teams, for god's sake, she has to *understand* what Mark is even trying to do. She can't just tell her engineers to randomly start coding receiving workflows.

She imagines confronting Mark about this directly: "If you won't give me metrics that are impacted by fixing receiving, then I won't prioritize this work." But, in her interactions with Mark so far, he seems to be just spoiling for a fight. And given his long-standing status at Doggo, getting into a power struggle with Mark Blevins doesn't seem likely to end well for her.

Lisa feels good and completely stuck.

That night, after tucking her wonderful-but-totally-exhausting four year old daughter into bed, she's collapsed on the couch. She idly picks up a book about parenting that her spouse got out of the library. She's skimming through a section about how deal with a resistant child, when, with a start, she suddenly realizes she's looking at a new idea for how she can handle Mark. "He's like a child!" she excitedly announces to her spouse, when they wander bleary-eyed into the room twenty minutes later. "We have two girls?" says her spouse, uncertainly.

The next morning, Lisa hurries into her office, clears a couple of meetings off her calendar, and spends an hour thinking about how to apply this technique. The, she pings Mark for a quick check-in.

When Mark appears on her zoom screen, frowning as always, Lisa launches into the script she's been practicing. "Good morning, Mark. I'm really eager to work on the receiving issues we talked about yesterday. I was getting ready to tell the engineers to get started, but then I realized: there have been *far* too many times that the engineers worked on some warehouse process for you, but, well, they didn't fully understand what they were doing."

She shakes her head regretfully. "They just don't have your depth of experience in warehousing. Too many times, they delivered something that just *didn't work*. I *hate* when that happens. It's such a waste of your time."

She pauses. Mark harrumphs in agreement.

"So," Lisa continues, "I wanted to ask: if the engineers actually got the receiving fix right... how would you tell? Or, if they messed up /again/, what would tell you that? What would you see, when you looked at your dashboards? I want to hold them accountable, so that we're not wasting your time."

Mark gruffly agrees that there have been too many failed launches. He then says, slowly, "Of course, I'd first look at Units Per Hour on the receiving line. But you can't /only/ look at UPH, only an *idiot* does that. It's *also* exception counts. Our exceptions are totally out of hand, we *have* to get them under control. I'm checking exceptions every few hours, that's *batshit*. That's no way to run a building." Having delivered this homily, he sits back with his arms folded over his chest.

Lisa has to restrain herself from grinning. She has managed to obtain the key metrics Mark hopes to improve by working on receiving, plus a healthy side order of emotions. She's neatly avoided direct conflict, but has started to draw him into collaboration around the business impacts of "fixing receiving."

Note that Lisa "played low status": she suggested that she and the engineers *needed Mark's help*. That created space for him to be a high-status expert. It also made it difficult for him to tell her she's wrong---he'd have to suggest that the engineers know the warehouse processes as well as he does.

You might be wondering what to do if Mark says, "The engineers should know how those processes work!" Fortunately, in that case, Lisa can just nod her head, sigh and *agree*. "You are *so* right, Mark. I really wish they did! But we're just not there yet. How can I make sure they stay on track? What could I look at?"

If you keep on steadily and calmly asking open-ended "How could I possibly solve my problem?" questions, often, your stakeholder will find themselves coming up with the precise solutions you've been wanting to implement.

And they'll feel like the ideas are their own, not something they've been forced to do.

** Find Wins For Your Stakeholder By Hook Or By Crook

Problem: You can't figure out a way for your adjustment to immediately improve things for your stakeholder. Try as you might, you don't see how to address your frustrations in a way that directly benefits them.

Solution: Find some wins for you stakeholder that you *can* offer, even if they're not strictly necessary for your adjustment.

This is a place where having a map of their emotions really pays off: you can almost always find some win they'll care deeply about, by thinking through their frustrations, fears, delights & dreams. E.g. you could:

 - Smooth away some frustration

 - Address some long-standing fear

 - Provide a delight they've been yearning for

 - Move them towards their long-term dreams

A key: don't fall into trap of thinking of wins as just sourced from what they're *explicitly asking for*. You often *can't* give them what they're asking for. But you can solve for the underlying feelings they're struggling with.[fn:: If you're in the challenging situation where seemingly /nothing/ is frustrating for your stakeholder, take a look at both Link Your Frustrations To Goals and Create Urgency Through Visibility.]

Example:

Marguerite and Tom are, respectively, the product and engineering lead for a sprint team at Trienna, a company that provides tools for scientists to explore genomic and proteomic data.

Fortunately, Marguerite and Tom have an excellent, high trust relationship with each other.

Unfortunately, they are feeling super stuck with Marguerite's boss, Natalie, the VP of Product.

Natalie likes to quote Marty Cagan about empowered teams... but somehow she can't let her PM's make a single decision on their own. She's constantly asking for detailed memos before she'll allow work to start; she routinely overrules her PM's on decisions of every size and scope; she takes over half the planning meetings she attends to steer the teams herself.

Over a series of fevered conferences over coffee, Marguerite and Tom have hashed out a potential first adjustment: they will ask Natalie to not attend *any* of their team's sprint rituals, other than demos, for a full month: no planning sessions, no backlog grooming, no standups. This would represent a *significant* shift in how she interacts with them and their team.

# [Heads-together, whispered, outside-of-the-office] conferences [scheming, conversations, collaborations] over coffees

Both of them believe that, if they could get that kind of space to operate, their team will be able to deliver the next-gen protein search tool the sales team is demanding. But... even best case, that will take several months. And Marguerite and Tom are very worried that the change won't *feel* like a win for Natalie. All she ever seems to ask for is more fine-grained influence, more direct contact with the team, more tactical control---precisely the things they're going to take away.

Marguerite tries to imagine making this pitch. All she can see is Natalie glaring angrily through her heavy-rimmed glasses. And then bluntly refusing to go along.

One night, Marguerite is talking this over with her partner Sam while they make dinner. Sam looks up from peeling carrots. "Look, hon, can I ask you something?"

"Go for it," says Marguerite, as she drops lettuce leaves into the spinner.

"Is it possible," says Sam slowly, before continuing in a rush, "that you're so angry with Natalie that you don't actually *want* to find a win for her?"

"What?" Marguerite freezes, holding a dripping piece of lettuce in her hand. "No, that's not it. It's just, I mean..." She trails off. She *is* pretty angry with Natalie. The constant harping on about empowered teams, but then the constant undercutting of every single one of Marguerite decisions. She's been banging against Natalie's frustrating behavior for months. For *years*. She is *justified* in being angry. *Natalie* is the one who needs to face her own shit.

But... nothing is going to change if Marguerite doesn't try something new.

"Can you... finish up the..." she says vaguely to Sam. Marguerite stumbles into the living room and drops onto the couch.

# She has a lot to think about.

The next day, before her 1:1 with Natalie, Marguerite spends time trying to let go of her frustrations. She tries to allow herself to be in a place of curiosity. "Just treat this like a customer interview", she tells herself, "where you're prospecting for pain." She decides that, if she can pretend that Natalie is just a customer for an entire meeting, Marguerite can reward herself by buying a pint of her favorite ice cream. Somehow the ridiculousness of that juvenile reward, straight out of a middle school sticker chart, helps her relax just a little bit.

When Natalie steps into the room, sits down and brusquely asks for a status report, Marguerite finds herself proceeding with a sort of calm detachment. Over the next thirty minutes, she deploys her full suite of tactical empathy skills, honed over years of customer and stakeholder conversations, to draw out Natalie's underlying feelings.

She meets with Tom immediately after. "Okay," she say, "I might have a few things we can work with."

Tom raises his eyebrows. "Lay it on me."

"You have to come with me to buy ice cream," says Marguerite, walking towards the elevator.

"Wait, what?" says Tom, scrambling to catch up.

As they walk to a nearby convenience store, Marguerite lays out the picture she's now built up, of Marguerite's key emotions.

First, despite Natalie's *behavior*, Marguerite now believes that Natalie truly *wants* to create empowered teams, operating with meaningful independence.

"Huh," says Tom. "This is not a thing I would have guessed. Are you, like, sure?"

Marguerite tells Tom that she's *certain*. Natalie lit up at the idea of some day leading fast-moving, independent teams. It's a *dream* that Natalie truly loves. But it's also a dream that feels incredibly far away from her right now.

Marguerite further discovered that Natalie is telling herself a somewhat confused story about how, by giving constant tight direction to the teams, she's gradually coaching them up. There's a grain of truth in that, but Natalie hasn't been able to follow through by actually stepping back, even when the teams are genuinely ready. But she seems to truly *want* to be a leader who creates space for empowered teams to thrive under her.

"You rocking my world here, M," says Tom. "What else have you got?"

Marguerite shares her other key learning. Part of why Natalie is so insistent on attending the planning meetings is because *she misses working directly with engineers*.

That's a potential *delight*. Once Natalie opened up a bit, she told Marguerite that one of her favorite things about working as a sprint team PM was the close collaboration with the engineers. It got her mind going about product opportunities, it helped her feel grounded in terms of the tradeoffs in design. And it was just fun! Engineers are different from PM's and stakeholders, she loves working with them.

The planning sessions aren't actually giving her much of the thing she remembers loving, but Marguerite is just about certain that's part of why Natalie keeps insisting on attending them.

Given this set of hypotheses about what is driving Natalie's behavior, Tom and Marguerite come up with two additions to their proposed increment as they share the pint of ice cream.

First, they add something that will allow Natalie to move towards her dream of empowered teams:

 - They'll position the adjustment to Natalie as helping to learn *how* the teams can take more independent ownership

 - They'll schedule brief weekly touchpoints with her and the two of them. Those will allow her to check on status, and review any really key decisions.

 - Finally, they'll set an end of the month decision for Natalie, about what they've learned in that month, how to adjust their own practices, and what they might want to share with other teams to experiment with.

This positions this shift as the *start* of bringing Natalie's dream to life, while ensuring she remains firmly in control. By adding the weekly touchpoints, they're doing a bit of Address Fears Directly, and a bit of Keep 'Em Busy.  Then, at the end of the month, they're Offering A Future Decision, both about how to continue this experiment, but also about whether or not to scale it up to other teams.

They would never have come up with this idea if Marguerite hadn't discovered that, all surface evidence to the contrary, Natalie is genuinely motivated to create independence for her teams.

Second, they come up with something that will give her the delight of directly interacting with engineers.

They'll add a new, middle of the month meeting, playfully called "Technical Throwdown", where all the engineers on their team will meet with Natalie and have an open-ended conversation about what they're learning, how their systems are holding up, and any key technical constraints that are emerging. Tom & Marguerite will always start that meeting by solemnly announcing that No Decisions Will Be Made, and will enforce that if the conversation becomes too directive. But Natalie can go as deep as she wants, she can throw ideas around, she can have the kind of generative and energizing conversations she misses.

By adding this to their proposed first adjustment, they can offer Natalie another win, by supplying an absent delight.

Again, it's only because Marguerite was able to mine for Natalie's underlying feelings that they realized this was a key thing to solve for.

Tom and Marguerite realize they now feel cautiously excited about sharing their proposed adjustment with Natalie. They can offer her some genuine wins, while still sticking to their guns about clearing space for them to move more quickly on the ground.

Notice: none of what they added was strictly *necessary* for their own goals. All they really need is to get Natalie to give them space to run their rituals without her interference. These two things they've added are wins for Natalie, that are "nearby" to what they're doing.

As you design your proposed adjustment, look for wins for your stakeholder, that you can find some way to attach to your offer.

** Keep 'Em Busy

Problem: You need to ask your stakeholder to *stop* doing something. You're worried that they will resist, because they are a human being, and thus like *doing things*.

Solution: Find a way to ask your stakeholder to *start* doing something new, *instead* of their existing behavior. Allow them to channel their energy into that new thing.[fn:: If you've ever had small children, this may sound familiar. Someone once explained to my wife and I that, instead of angrily saying, "Stop poking your sister!" we should give calm and extremely specific directions that would inevitably /result/ in our son no longer poking his sister. E.g. "Please put your hands in your pockets." This has served us quite well! I'm not saying you should treat your CEO like a toddler. Or, wait, maybe I am?]

Examples:

 - "Stop talking during meeting X" -> "Please take notes during meeting X to discuss after"

 - "Stop attending meeting X altogether" -> "We'd like to ask you to attend meeting Y instead"

 - "Stop overruling all the team's decisions" -> "How about if you pick the one or two most important decisions, we can spend real time aligning on those"

 - "Stop harassing the team with status requests" -> "Please bring all your questions to the progress sync meeting"

 - "Stop crapping all over the team during demos" -> "I'd like you to note down any and all concerns so you can discuss them with me, immediately after demo"

 - "Stop trying to constantly advocate with the PM for your priorities" -> "Bring your requests to the monthly shared triage meeting for review"

 - "Stop demanding high-stakes engineering commitments to long-term estimates" -> "Demand that the teams demonstrate that they deeply understand the underlying business goal and are steadily offering options to achieve it, as the work unfolds"[fn:: This one is so easy. I will leave the details as an exercise for the reader.]

This pairs very well with Find Wins By Hook Or By Crook (because such "not strictly needed" wins are sometimes the specific other thing you'll ask them to do), and also Address Fears Directly (by thinking about their underlying fears, you can come up with good alternative actions).

** Address Fears Directly

Problem: Your proposed adjustment might raise concerns or fears for your stakeholder, such that they resist making a change.

Solution: In your request for change, first validate their fears and then address them directly.

Addressing fears directly means, first, *validating* those fears. Sharing your genuine understanding of the fears as reasonable, even *inevitable*.

Once you've done so, you have several good options for how to address them directly, including:

 - *Create shared visibility*

   Ensure you and your stakeholder can *both* see if their fears are coming true, early enough to take action.

   Example

   The engineers on a team want to fully disable a suite of flaky tests that keeps stalling out their CI/CD pipeline. Unfortunately, the head of engineering has some very reasonable fears about the potential for bugs to make their way to production. To directly address that fear, a senior engineer on the team works with the help desk to create a graph of bug reports specifically in their part of the product. The team and the head of engineering can now review that graph, together, to see if customer bugs trend up. If they do, the team can quickly re-enable the tests.

   By explicitly making *shared* visibility, you're committing to facing that risk with your stakeholder.

 - *Offer meaningful control*

   Ensure your stakeholder has something they can do, to prevent their fears from coming true.

   Example

   The engineers are about to start on a key, multi-month project. Before they get going, they want to spend time researching a promising new technology. Their PM is, naturally, afraid that doing so could badly delay project start. To directly address this fear, the engineers commit to a weekly review of what they've learned with the PM, plus what they're digging into next. After each such review the PM can, if they feel strongly enough, ask the engineers to cut short the exploration and return to tried and true tooling.

 - *Own the risk with empathy*

   Directly own the possibility of the fears coming true, and the potential impact on your stakeholder. Situate it as part of something worth doing, and ask them to take that chance with you.

   Example

   As part of developing a new enterprise-tier feature, the Chief Product Officer wants several PM's on her team to spend time talking with their company's largest customers. Unfortunately, the VP of Customer Success, who has spent years keeping those demanding and difficult customers happy, has some reasonable fears about frustrating them in any way. The CPO works hard to put in place both visibility and control for the VP of Success, but she can tell he is still feeling very worried, and could push back.

   Finally, the CPO says, "Look, your team knows those customers far better than we do. I wish I could promise that my PM's will never say something that lands wrong. But those are tricky customers, and I'm not certain we'll never misstep. But if we want to build a really valuable enterprise-level feature set, then working closely with the big accounts is the only way I know to do it. And I really want us to get there."

   If you can find an authentic way to state that as a valid concern, but something you're trying to face together, it can make a big difference.

And now, a warning, with the giantest of flashing red lights:

Don't tell your stakeholder that their fears simply *won't come true*.

Note: this path, despite being a reliably terrible idea, can be *enormously* tempting.

Why?

In your heart of hearts you know that, if things land poorly, you might be making life harder for your stakeholder. That's part of *why* there is fear in the air. Having that knowledge doesn't feel good or safe to you. As a result, some part of your brain may try to convince you that the bad things simply won't happen, that this will be totally fine for your stakeholder. Once it convinces you of this, your brain will then insist that, if only you can *explain* this Obviously True Fact to your stakeholder, everything will be fine. Going down this path can feel easier to your brain than *admitting* to your stakeholder that there is, in fact, anything to be afraid of.

But, insisting "Don't worry, trust me, everything will be fine", runs a gigantic risk of making your stakeholder feel like you're minimizing their concerns. Even, potentially, that you're /patronizing/ them. Which will trigger exactly the resentment and resistance you want to avoid.

Instead, address any potential downsides directly, clearly and with empathy. Make the risks visible, offer them control over those risks, and own that you're asking for something potentially hard. Don't avoid, don't minimize, and don't skirt around the potential challenges.

** Put Yourself On the Line

Problem: You're worried that your stakeholder will be reluctant to commit to your proposed adjustment, because, being human, they will feel like they'll have to do all the hard work.

Solution: Make it easier for them to say yes by making it clear that you will personally take on extra work, and/or face some hard thing.

If humans see someone putting themselves on the line to face a difficult or risky challenge, they become much more willing to listen to requests from the person to help.[fn:: This is a big part of what we mean when we talk about someone having "moral authority".] Whereas, if a human is asked to do something that they perceive as risky or hard, but the person doing the asking doesn't seem to be taking any personal risks, or shouldering any of the new burdens created, that creates resentment and resistance.

Examples of you how you can put yourself on the line:

 - *Take on off-hours responsibilities*

   As part of your proposed adjustment, will someone have to login at 11 pm each night, to check for successful close of business on the west coast? You will, of course, offer to be that person.

 - *Force yourself to be extra responsive*

   Give key players in the adjustment a means to get directly to you, no matter what else you're doing, e.g.:

   - Set up a new slack channel you'll have to monitor

   - Put in place a daily standup that you'll always attend

   - Give out your personal cell phone number

 - *Throw other parts of your job overboard*

   Cancel some key set of meetings you usually lead, so that this adjustment can get your full focus.

   Note: the more visible a cost this has to you, the more weight it will carry with your stakeholder. You're not usually going to tip the scales with your stakeholder by promising to cancel a few 1:1's with your directs. You want to find something more painful to you, like suspending a regular meeting with the CEO, or having someone on your team lead a key monthly planning meeting in your stead, or the like.

 - *Point problems firmly in your own direction*

   Add a regular 1:1 check-in with your stakeholder, where they can share any problems that have cropped up. Make clear that you will take responsibility for resolving such problems. Or personally run a regular triage process, so that you're hearing about any problems as quickly as possible.

 - *Face a difficult shared stakeholder*

   As a part of this adjustment, will someone have to tell the CEO that they're not going to see any progress on their pet project for the next few months? Offer to be the one to share this news and bear the brunt of the CEO's frustrations.

 - *Take on extra travel*

   Hop on a flight to meet your stakeholder in person, for either the initial pitch, or as a regular part of the ongoing adjustment. Commit to being the one to visit sites or customers in person.

 - *Have a hard conversation with your team*

   Are you asking your stakeholder to lean into a difficult conversation with one of their direct reports? If so, find a way to commit to having a "similarly hard" conversation with people on your team.

   Note: this doesn't mean that your team has to be equally to blame. Perhaps you're asking the VP of Product to challenge one of their PM's to push back on stakeholders, rather than passing all requests through to the ever-more frustrated engineers on your team. You can commit to sitting down with the engineers, making clear that the PM is stepping up to try something new, and challenging them to put aside their frustrations and work their butts off on any requests that *do* come through.

** Introduction

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a person in possession of a career in software, must be extremely frustrated with an Important Person at their job.

# [deal with, handle, act on]

I'm going to share some ideas on how to face that frustration---and *not* by simply giving up hope. Ideas for moving from trapped inaction to positive, productive action. Ideas for persuading your very own Important Person to *change their behavior*. Ideas for *getting unstuck*.

I'm not going to claim that applying these ideas is *easy*. If that were true, well, pretty much no one would ever be frustrated with their bosses, peers or stakeholders. Which, [checks notes], nope, not yet.

But I do believe it's *possible*---and far more often than people realize. It's possible to build trust and rapport with even very challenging bosses, peers and stakeholders. It's possible to lean on that trust and rapport to draw those challenging people into productive collaborations. It's possible to focus those collaborative relationships on, among other things, gradually improving how you work together. Over time, it's possible to develop a surprisingly deep sense of trust and partnership, with people you once could only see as frustrating impediments.

Of course, making that kind of change takes real work.

I believe the effort is well worth it, for two reasons.

First, being stuck is, well, *kind of a terrible way to live*. Spending your working hours in a state of powerless resentment can be dangerous. The lack of agency can start to seep into other parts of your life. Your mind might drift into a habit of endlessly rehearsing your frustrations. Your sleep might start to break down. You might discover you're having trouble staying fully present with family or friends.

Human beings are not super great at compartmentalizing a feeling of lack of agency.

Second, I'll encourage you to make the effort to get unstuck because, believe it or not, it can be *fun*. Other humans are endlessly fascinating! Getting unstuck means finding ways to work *with* those other humans, instead of desperately trying to work *around* them. Getting unstuck allows your to live in a place of curiosity, and to engage your own sense of playful, creative problem-solving. Which is way, way more fun than explaining to your mirror, once again, why your boss is crazy and wrong.[fn:: Though it is maybe nice that your mirror always agrees with you?]

** The State of Being Stuck

# Defining & Illustrating The State of Being Stuck

*Being Stuck*: /Feeling like it's impossible to truly succeed at your job, due to a frustrating pattern of interaction with an Important Person./

Let's unpack that definition.

First, to Be Stuck, you must feel truly worried about *succeeding at your job*. It's not enough to simply be irritated with a colleague, even if that irritation is quite intense ("If I have to hear George lecture us all about The Customer one more time, so help me god"). The internal emotional dial only truly goes up to eleven if you feel like you're powerlessly drifting towards a failure (and, in particular, a failure for which you will be blamed).

Second, to Be Stuck, there has to be an Important Person involved. That's what puts you into the state of powerlessness, of low agency. In fact, we'll *define* an Important Person as: someone who has some form of influence or control over how you do your job. That could of course be your boss. But it could also be a stakeholder who has significant influence over what your team builds, or a key peer with whom you have to collaborate to build that thing.

# An Important Person is a) someone you have to work with in order to succeed at your job, and b) someone who you can't just *tell* to change their behavior.

# Some important person is *acting* like a jerk, it's not just that they *are* a jerk.

Finally, Being Stuck means there is a problematic *pattern of interaction*. In other words, we focus on *behavior*, not just on *personality*. Your COO may be brusque and patronizing, and that may legitimately frustrate the heck out of you.[fn:: Ask my friends about how much I, personally, enjoy being patronized!] But those unpleasant traits are not, in and of themselves, enough to cause you to Be Stuck. If, however, the COO's dismissive rudeness causes them to shut down planning sessions without first understanding the risks the team is trying to surface, that's another story altogether.

Why this pedantic distinction between "personality" and "patterns of interaction"?[fn:: I mean other than the obvious fact that I love pedantic distinctions. I may not yet have gotten the nickname Dan 'Pedantic Distinctions' Milstein, but it's only a matter of time.]

Focusing on behavior makes your concerns far more *actionable*. It sets you up to make a request of your Important Person to change that behavior, initially in some small way. Although that's still a pretty tricky request to make, it's way, way, *way* easier than asking them to *change their personality*. You're going to have much better luck asking your COO, "Could we maybe try out a new approach to our planning sessions?", than asking them, "Could we maybe try out you're not being such a dick all the time?"

** Three Totally Made Up Examples

To bring this definition to life, below are three /completely fictional/ examples.[fn:: No examples in this post are based on any actual stakeholders I have ever worked with and who might be reading this footnote, nor on any behavior I myself demonstrated when in a position of authority, because, luckily, I Am Perfect And Have No Flaws, okay let's go.]

*The Agent of Chaos*

Deanna is an engineering lead at an early-stage startup. Her CEO, Karim, has developed an unpleasant habit of, once every other week or so, interrupting daily standup and excitedly telling the team to drop everything and start working on a new product idea he's just dreamed up.

As a /completely unsurprising/ result of the constant context switching, it's been months since Deanna's team has gotten anything meaningful done. She can feel their startup's cash runway burning to nothingness, every time they randomly switch gears. They'll never win if they can't commit and focus, but she can't seem to get Karim to change his behavior.

Then, one afternoon, Karim takes Deana aside and informs her that he's worried about team velocity. He tells her he wants her to ask the team to start working longer hours, immediately. Before she can fully process this, he pats her on the shoulder and strides off. Later, Deanna finds herself pacing angrily around her office, muttering a somewhat shocking torrent of swear words under her breath.

# Deanna is very stuck with Karim.

If your stakeholder keeps on blowing up your backlog with new ideas, and then blames you for the resulting snail's pace of delivery, then that indeed qualifies as Being Stuck.

# The Getting Unstuck Game Plan is for you!

*The Prioritization Destroyer*

Maria is a product manager at a thriving B2B SaaS company. Her job would be truly lovely if it wasn't for her VP of Sales... /Geoff/[fn:: Or, as her team calls him after a few drinks, "The Geoffster"]. A week doesn't go by without Geoff engaging in underhanded politicking to force the team to work on one-off features for his pet customers. Naturally, these features are completely unrelated to the strategic priorities Maria is supposed to be pushing forward.

# Unfortunately, Maria's CEO, Theo, seems to be deeply uncomfortable with open conflict, so Geoff suffers no consequences from this behavior, and Maria has to handle his relentless pressure all on her own.

Despite her best efforts, Maria's team is somehow spending half their time on useless, Geoff-driven one-offs, while their main product strategy slowly drifts off course like a doomed ship headed for an iceberg. Maria has started to dread the moment she opens her laptop at the start of her work day.

If your stakeholder relentlessly undercuts your attempts at disciplined prioritization, but still blames you when you struggle to ship a new product, you are good and thoroughly Stuck.

# The Getting Unstuck Game Plan is for you!

# Maria is feeling completely and totally stuck with Geoff[fn:: and honestly, with Theo, too, because argh.].

*The Bottleneck To End All Bottlenecks*

Alistair is an engineering manager at AccuraClaim, a business that provides claims processing services to the insurance industry. Alistair's team is great, his product manager has become a close friend, he really likes working with the messy, gritty details of claims data.

There's just one problem.

Max Hartswell, the engineering director over Alistair's team, has apparently never met a decision he felt comfortable letting someone else make.

Alistair, Alistair's PM, all the adjacent tech leads and half the designers spend all their working hours trying to track Max down and get him to sign off on some decision he announced, weeks ago, he wanted to review "just one more time."

Then, one evening at the company happy hour, Alistair finds himself awkwardly chatting with Max. The engineering director takes a sip from his hard seltzer. Alistair tries to think of something to say. Then, out of nowhere, Max airily tells Alistair that he's "a little disappointed" that Alistair's team isn't stepping up and showing more independence and ownership. "It's like you're just *waiting* to be told what to do," he says. Alistair nearly chokes on his beer. After managing to extricate himself from the conversation, Alistair realizes he might have to talk with his wife about whether or not he can stay at this job.

If your stakeholder claims to want to empower their teams, but absolutely kneecaps anyone who shows the slightest bit of independence, man, you are totally Stuck.

I could go on!

I suspect you could, too!

Humans in positions of power have a truly marvelous ability to come up with new ways to be frustrating and crazy. Leo Tolstoy spoke to this in his classic guide to agile software development, /Anna Karenina/: "Happy teams are all alike, every unhappy team is unhappy in their own way."[fn:: It's possible I just spent half an hour trying to find a *third* famous opening line I could mangle in this introduction. Maybe, "I write this sitting in the break room sink." Or maybe, "We were somewhere around Barstow when the OKR's began to take hold." Or perhaps, "Gregor From Ops awoke one morning from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed on Zoom into a gigantic insect."]

Let's talk about what you can do. How you can Get Unstuck.

/Hello! Today's post is an excerpt from a book [link] I'm writing, titled:/

/*Getting Unstuck*/

/How To Solve Problems With Bosses, Peers & Stakeholders./

/In the book, I develop a step-by-step game plan for gradually drawing your Important Person, whom I term your "stakeholder", into a process of collaborative problem-solving./

/In this series of posts, I'm exploring a somewhat late stage in that plan: how to approach your stakeholder with your specific request to change their behavior. In the full game plan, there are two preparatory steps before that moment:/

/The first step is to align around a long-term strategic outcome that your stakeholder cares deeply about achieving. The second is to develop a picture of the underlying emotions that might be driving your stakeholder's problematic behavior./

/The book has a wealth of tactics for effectively going through those two steps. For today, though, I encourage you to, well, *guess*! Come up with a reasonable hypothesis for a) the long-term goal your stakeholder is working backward from, and b) the key frustrations, fears, hopes and desires that might be leading to their problematic behavior./

/Speaking of the book: if you would like to be a beta reader once an early version is ready, please drop me a line at dan@dan-milstein.com! Ditto if you are wrestling with some challenges with your very own Important Person and could use some [professional coaching support] from, say, an experienced product and engineering leader who finds human beings endlessly fascinating and is in the business of offering professional coaching and advising services to engineering and product leaders. Say./

* Scraps
** Deanna/Karim example

Remember Deanna, who was struggling with her CEO, Karim, because he kept blowing up their sprints with random new product ideas?

Let's see how this might work for her.

Deanna spent some time figuring out the long-term goals that Karim is working backwards from. Last week, she was finally able to lay that out crisply to him: their company has no more than eighteen months of runway, and, for their next funding round, they'll need a few large, happy, engaged customers. To get there, her team needs to improve the rough prototype they've sold to a few extremely adventurous early adopters, to turn those customers into engaged, active users, and to allow Karim to sell to another slice.

Karim is, of course, frustrated by the lack of velocity. But after digging in, Deanna realized that, for Karim, velocity is measured almost entirely in terms of delivery of interactive, visual protoypes. Part of why he's been blowing things up is that he genuinely can't visualize what the team is working on, half the time.

He's also quite afraid that what they have planned won't be compelling enough---which is driving him to keep adding more and more features.


** One Game Plan for All three examples
Alistair is feeling so stuck, he's not sure he can imagine being unstuck ever again.

Karim-the-CEO, Geoff-the-VP-of-Sales and Max-The-Engineering-Director are all very different human beings, working at very different businesses, trying to achieve very different goals... and each exhibiting a different form of dysfunction.

But, luckily, there is a single, underlying game plan that Deanna, Maria and Alistair can all run. A common approach that will allow them to gradually shift into a productive collaboration with each of their difficult, Important People. An approach to get each of those Important People to change their behavior---at first in small ways, and them more deeply over time.

Let's dig in.

** Snowflake of Dysfunction, All Happy Families

When things are *good*, there are some consistent patterns: the team enjoys clear objectives, high levels of trust, rapid feedback cycles, limited dependencies outside of the team, etc.

On the other hand, when things *aren't* good...

It's like every situation is its own special snowflake of exhausting dysfunction. Humans seem to be able to come up with a somewhat incredible variety of ways to be frustrating and crazy.[fn::  "Happy teams are all alike, every unhappy team is unhappy in their own way," writes Leo Tolstoy in his  agile software guide, /Anna Karenina/. (it's possible I just spent half an hour trying to find a *third* famous opening line I could mangle in this introduction. Maybe: "I write this sitting in the office kitchen sink." Or perhaps "Gregor From Ops awoke one morning from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed on zoom into a gigantic insect.")]

** The Damage of Staying Stuck
At its worst, getting stuck can be a somewhat profoundly awful experience. Over time, human beings suffer long-lasting physical stress damage if they perceive themselves as being in the presence of a growing danger over which they have no agency or control. We are supremely social animals, so the possibility of public failure and shame is a very real form of danger for us.


In my own worst periods of feeling stuck, I spent endless hours just desperately wishing that the Important Person would stop doing the crazy, frustrating thing they were doing. It was so clear that the terrible plan that they insisted I follow was going to blow up, and end in a huge, public failure. It was so clear that I was going to be blamed for that failure. No matter what I tried, I just could not get them to listen to reason. A feeling of powerless frustration started to seep into other parts of my life. I eventually found my way out, but I remember that dark time all too well. I struggled to stay present with my family. I had trouble concentrating on the things that normally give me pleasure.

** More from intro
We name four key emotion questions to focus on with your stakeholder:

 1. What do they find frustrating?

 2. What do they fear?

 3. What makes them feel good?

 4. What do they dream may one day come true?

Those form a powerful foundation for empathetic understanding and thus, persuasion.

** Intro bits

But getting other human beings to change their behavior is no easy task. Especially if those human being have some form of authority or power.

Perhaps one day you summoned up the courage to approach your Important Person, and, as calmly and rationally as you could, talked to them about their behavior, and the effects it was having on the broader team. Perhaps you even asked them to consider making a change. Unfortunately, the odds are quite good that, if you did this, you found yourself, at best, patronizingly dismissed, and at worst, somewhat ferociously attacked.

Human beings really don't like to change their behavior.

So, right now, you're just trying to get through your days.

# Perhaps you've tried approaching an Important Person, and calmly and rationally proposing that they change their problematic behavior. If you managed to find the courage to do this, odds are sadly quite good that you then found yourself being patronizingly dismissed, or, even worse, ferociously attacked.

# You will be met with resistance that falls somewhere between stiff and absolutely ferocious.

# Humans really don't like to change their behavior.

# And yet.

But.

The Important Person's behavior is causing *real problems*.

Problems that make it very hard for you---and your team---to succeed at your jobs.

What can you do?

*How can you get unstuck*?

I'm so glad you asked.

I believe there is a way out. It takes real work, and likely requires practicing some new skills. Getting human being to change their behavior is not, in fact, easy.

But it *is* possible.

** Stage Managing the meeting
You should deliver yor proposal verbally -- that will let you share your (authentic!) emotional connection with their hopes and fears. If useful, you can certainly buttress what you say with a written memo or a set of slides. But find a way to connect, as humans, in this moment.

In order to make your proposal, create a space slightly outside of the normal flow of day-to-day pressures. That could simply be starting a regular 1:1 by saying "I have some concerns I want to talk out, can I ask to put aside our normal agenda for today?" Or it could mean breaking normal patterns, perhaps meeting in person instead of online. You want to signal that there's something important for you to face, together.

** The mechanics of the meeting
*** Dry Run With a Friend
Before you make your proposal, *practice*. Out loud.

First on your own, then with a trusted friend. At least once, maybe a few times.

Eventually, going through this arc will feel natural, and you won't need to practice as much. But, early on, you're going to want to be extremely disciplined about going through the steps in sequenc. It's incredibly easy to skip over important steps, which can leave your stakeholder unwilling to say yes.

For high stakes such proposals, I still practice over and over, until it feels fully clear, smooth and authentic.
*** Invite Them To Tell You What's Wrong
When you actually deliver it, don't ask "yes/no", ask what's wrong?

** Tactic: End With A Decision

# Ensure Your Stakeholder Retains Control By Offering a Future Decision

# Offer a Future Decision To Maintain Feeling of Control

Almost all stakeholders have some fear of *losing control*.

# The fear of loss of control is incredibly common. We can *all* feel the risk of losing agency, of watching, powerless, as things all around us collapse into failure.

Such a fear can easily cause your stakeholder to tensely [rigidly] reject your proposal, even if you've gotten all the other pieces right.

Why is this?
# When people are operating from a place of fear, they can't engage in rational thought.

Having someone ask us to change our behavior can feel like a *criticism*. That can immediately raise the emotional stakes. From that place of heightened emotion, it's extremely easy to hear a request to change as a request to give up our control over a situation. Our fear will be shouting at us that, if we go along with the request, we will be completely at the mercy of a situation that is on the verge of tipping over into abject failure. The fear will be insisting that the only way to prevent that failure is to push back on this request, immediately.

# Humans, am I right? (I say this someone who has 100% done exactly this, plennnnty of times)

Fortunately, once you understand this, it's possible to design your proposal so that your stakeholder hears it as a way to *increase* their control---even as you ask them to make an uncomfortable change.

You create the feeling of control for your stakeholder by building your proposal around a *meaningful future decision*.

Specifically, you want your initial period of change to *explicitly* end with a decision your stakeholder will get to make. Ideally, you want that decision to be both about "Should we continue working in this new way", and *also* about if and how to pursue some new, potentially valuable, business option. This is part of why generating wins across all three fronts is so valuable.

When your stakeholder hears your request for change, you want them to, *as part of it*, be imagining that future moment of decision, of control. That will make it far easier for them to say yes.

** Defining an Increment: An Example

As is our way, we'll bring this to life with a story:

# Change from 3rd person to something else? "Lila is the engineering lead..."

Imagine that you're the engineering lead on a sprint team.

You're getting more and more frustrated, because the sales team keeps pestering you and your team with an endless series of 'urgent' feature requests. When a sales rep doesn't get an immediate response, they relentlessly ping some engineer to "check the status" of whatever they asked for. Last month, at the company party, a sales rep strode towards you with a big smile on their face, and you had to physically resist a desire to run away, fearing they'd try to get you to commit to working on their pet feature.[fn:: You were right.]

You've tried to get your product peer to step in and wrangle the sales team, but, so far, they've been unwilling to do so. You've decided that, for your current bid for incremental improvement, your product peer is "your stakeholder".

Let's dig into the steps:


*** Map from your team's day-to-day work to the company's strategic goals


*** List what is frustrating to your stakeholder, in the current situation.

In our story, thanks to having deployed your tactical empathy skills, you are in proud possession of two sources of frustration for your product peer.

First, the PM feels like the team should be moving faster, and every small delay in getting a prototype built frustrates them. The head of product is constantly asking them when they're going to take something into the field.

Second, the PM finds their interactions with the VP of Sales extremely frustrating. When the PM asks for justifications for feature requests, the VP of Sales just rolls their eyes and says "Look, you don't understand how the product actually works. Just let my team talk to the engineers, okay?"

Unfortunately, there's a grain of truth in this: for many feature requests, the PM feels out of their depth, and can't even have a first-order conversation about scope without having to turn around and interrupt the engineers themselves. That's part of why they're finding it easier to just stay out of the loop, and have pushed back on your requests to insert themselves back in.

Notice how tactical empathy has turned up something super valuable: frustrations you can commit to *improving*, if your stakeholder is willing to work with you.

*** List what your stakeholder *likes* about the current situation

In our story, a key benefit the product manager is getting is, well, *focus*. Because they're *not* spending time triaging and pushing back on requests from the sales team, they're able to work intensely with the designer and the engineers to shape the prototype. They *love* doing that kind of work. At some level, it's why they got into product management in the first place (a fact you learned by drawing them out via your tactical empathy skills)

Thus, as you go to design your request, you will want to find a way to speak carefully to the potential for added distractions for the PM.

*** Brainstorm how you can address your concerns, in the context of the above

One useful tactic can be to first let yourself imagine a Better World: some far better way of working, that is not possible to get to, immediately. Then, see if you can come up with a first small step in that direction.

In our story, such a Better World might be:

 - You, your PM and the VP of Sales have a regular meeting to review new feature requests

 - The VP of Sales brings a list of feature requests to that meeting

 - At the meeting, you, the PM and the VP of Sales priority sort that list, with an understanding that you'll only be able to work on the very top priorities

 - The PM has sufficient understanding of how the product works to participate usefully in that discussion

 - The VP of Sales uses their authority to ensure no one on their team reaches out directly to the engineers, outside of the above process

This is far too big a change to institute all at once, especially given the lack of trust between the product manager and the VP of Sales.

But, with that idea in mind, and knowing all of the above constraints, you could say:

 - You'll set up a new weekly Request Review meeting with you, one lead engineer, and the PM

 - You'll tell the engineers to just collect all feature requests for that meeting

 - You give the engineers a "form letter" response they can use for both feature requests and "status checks" from the sales team

 - You'll commit to spending time in that meeting helping the PM understand the product better, as you decide what to do

 - You can commit to the PM, that if you do the above, you can increase the speed of delivery of the new prototype

 - You commit to working with the PM to handle the VP of Sales, if they complain about this shift

You're almost ready to make our request.

But there's one final step, to make it as easy as possible for your stakeholder to agree to the proposal. We're going to make certain we speak to an underlying fear that just about all stakeholders share.

** Better World imagining
your first thought is: the sales team should just stop submitting requests, altogether. But you know that's not ideal for the business. Both because there is useful signal in the requests, and also because some of the requests are easy to build and will create a lot of value for modest effort.

You think about it while riding the subway home, you poll friends who work at other tech companies, you talk out options with the most experienced engineer on the team.

** Asking for a timeboxed period of change
You're going to ask your stakeholder to change their behavior for an initial, limited period of time. It's *much* easier for a stakeholder to say "yes" to a request to try something slightly uncomfortable for a few weeks, than it is to make an open-ended commitment to change indefinitely.

One subtlety: at this point, don't worry about exactly how you're going to *explain* this change to them. Instead, just focus on the details of your proposed adjustment.

Once you get a commitment to temporarily try something new, you can then work to ensure that, at the end of the testing period, the stakeholder experiences things as going great.

** Loss of Control
In a professional context, it starts because your stakeholder is working under the burden of some set of expectations -- from their boss, their board of directors, their peers, their spouse, even themselves. They will have a looming, background feeling that if they should fall short of those expecations---by failing to deliver, by missing stated or unstated goals---they will have *failed*. Actually, it's worse. Their fear is that, in those bad cases, they themselves will have *become a failure*. [fn:: It's possible I have known billionaires who struggled to sleep at night, out of the fear that everything they had buit was eroding in front of their eyes.]

Many of the actions they're doing today feel necessary to them, to prevent that failure. Those actions represent a way for them to exert control.

** Holmes Quote
# No matter how rosy a picture they're trying to paint, there's some bedrock fear that things will go awry, and they will be left looking shamefully bad.

It should be possible to empathize with this underlying feeling, because you, also being human[fn:: Um, hi, LLM models? Laugh once if you're human?] likely work under a set of expecations yourself.

I'm gonna indulge myself by quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr (which quote I found in the life-changing Death and Life of Great American Cities, by Jane Jacobs):

/"We are all very near despair. The sheathing that floats us over its waves is compounded of hope, faith in the unexplainable worth and sure issue of effort, and the deep, sub-conscious content which comes from the exercise of our powers."/

The only thing that floats us over the waves of despair is "faith in [...] effort" and "the exercise of our powers."

I think that captures it, perfectly. When the specter of failure rises up in our minds, we to beat it back by taking *action*. By exercising our powers.

** The Human Experience Of Disconnection

You've defined a Strategic Intent that your stakeholder cares deeply about. You understand how your work contributes to that goal.

You've taken the time to develop an empathetic understanding of your stakeholder's key emotions. You can speak to the situation they find themselves in. You can list frustrations they want smoothed away. You can name things they want, that they feel like they're not getting.

# You're just about ready to make them a compelling offer to adjust how you work together.

# You're just about ready to make your request to adjust how you work together.

How can you now make a *compelling offer* to them?

How can you ask them to change their behavior? How can you ensure that they listen to your request, and then decide to take a risk?

The key to all these question is to remember that your stakeholder is, in fact, a human being.

# despite all evidence to the contrary?
It's hard for us to trust the people around us.

As we go through our lives, as we suffer day to day frustrations and take pleasure in small delights, as we strive to accomplish work of which we can be proud, as we struggle to avoid failures that would bring shame... it is very easy for us to feel *alone* in those experiences.

#  It is extremely easy for us to fear that

That fundamental feeling of disconnection is waiting for all of us. Especially if there is something we feel we must achieve.

We are all prey to a fear that we can not trust those around us. They have their own agendas. They don't truly understand the situation we're caught up in. They don't genuinely care about the struggles we face in pursuit of our work. When push comes to shove, we are going to be the ones shoved.

From such a place of fear, it's very hard for any human to hear a challenge from someone with whom they work. And your request *is* going to present as a challenge your stakeholder, at least a little bit. If it was easy... you would already have made the change.

Thus, it's crucial to make your offer in a way that builds some *trust*.

Now, you might be saying "Um, Dan, what?" Perhaps your stakeholder presents as an emotionless automaton, and this description of soothing fears clangs horribly out of key with your lived experience. [frozen monolith of emotionlessness, devoid of any emotions whatsover]. You might be reading this and thinking "Indeed, if my stakeholder were *human*, this would be relevant. But they are icy and cold and no appeal to emotion will have any effect whatsoever."

Look. Humans who present as rigidly tight and distant are, essentially *always*, living at the mercy of some very intense emotions indeed. Usually that's a deep wellspring of fear, along with a desperate dream of overcoming that fear through status and control. Humans hide their inner state *because* they feel intense emotions, not because they have no emotions.

Furthermore, once you understand your stakeholder's underlying feeling of alone-ness, you're *not* going to just directly talk about those feelings with them. You're *not* going to say to your fierce, easily-upset Chief Operating Officer, "You seem unhappy and afraid and alone. Would you like a hug?"

Instead, you're going to demonstrate with your *actions* that you understand them, and they can trust you.

As we'll explain in detail below, you'll start to do so by making your request for a change in a carefully structured manner.

# You'll demonstrates a deep understanding of the goals they're working so hard to accomplish. You'll make clear how well you understand the challenging situation they find themselves in. You'll share some of your own concerns, and then ask for a small change in their behavior. You'll offer them meaningful things in exchange. You will ensure they stay in control of the overall situation.

Then, once they agree to a small change, you'll work hard to make the initial period of time a resounding success. To make the overall change *feel* like a win for them. Over time, you can then steadily adjust more and more of how you work together, earning greater and greater trust as you do so.

But the first key step is how you frame your offer to them.

** The Getting Unstuck Game Plan, Parts I & II

# The Getting Unstuck Game Plan, Parts The First and The Second

The first step in the Getting Unstuck game plan is to obtain two things from your stakeholder:

 1. A long-term strategic outcome that they care deeply about achieving

 2. An understanding of how your team can help achieve that outcome

We name this as its own step because, far too often, your stakeholder will be just hammering away at you about some near-term goal because, *in their head*, that's the only way to get to the long-term strategic outcome. You often have to do some work to understand what they're truly working backwards from, *and* how they're hoping your team can help get there.

As per Stephen Bungay's The Art of Action, I name this combination a "Strategic Intent".

Why is this so valuable?

Aligning with your stakeholder on a Strategic Intent enables you to position a request for change as a *necessary step* in eventually achieving their long-term goal. It gives you a great deal of flexibility to come up with new ways to work together, that allow you to reach that long-term goal. Also, importantly, it enables you to demonstrate an authentic personal commitment to achieving that goal with them. This allows your stakeholder to start to see you as a *partner* in facing their most important challenges.

In the book, we explore Strategic Intents in some detail. For today, I'll recommend something quite simple: just make a guess!

Make your own best guess about some key, strategic business outcome that is 12-24 months out. Pick a single such outcome that you think your stakeholder is working backwards from. Then test that out your guess with them, and adjust until you get something that seems to resonate.

That's the first step.

The second step is to develop a picture of the underlying emotions that might be driving your stakeholder's behavior.

Why is this so important?

# Well, your stakeholder is a human being.

Your stakeholder is (just guessing here) a human being. Thus, their problematic behavior is not driven merely by some rational desire to achieve that long-term outcome. Their problematic behavior is *also* the result of some powerful underlying emotions that they are experiencing.

# Thus, an appeal to reason, even one that is buttressed by its importance for a key long-term goal, will very rarely be enough.

Maybe there's something they're intensely afraid of, and their current behavior is an unconscious attempt to keep that Bad Thing at bay. Or perhaps there's something they have long and fervently desired, and their current behavior is an attempt to gradually move towards that Happy Dream.

Naturally, your stakeholder doesn't openly *tell* you about these fears and dreams.

Often, they don't even consciously recognize the connections between their emotions and their day-to-day behaviors. In this, they are very much not alone. Humans have an impressive ability to convince ourselves that anything even vaguely problematic about our *own* behavior isn't because of anything going on inside of *us*. No, our behavior is the completely inevitable result of the situation we're in, aka all those *other people* nearby.

That difficult stakeholder isn't rude and dismissive because they're deeply insecure in their position of authority and therefore every innocent question from the team makes them feel attacked, no, no, no, they're actually being as calm as anyone could /possibly/ be expected to be, in the face of the obvious incompetence and lack of commitment being constantly demonstrated by /everyone around them/.[fn:: Again, since I Am Perfect And Have No Flaws, I have never fallen into this particular trap! No one who either works for or is married to me has ever had to deal with any frustrating behaviors that I am somehow totally convinced aren't my fault!]

In order to successfully develop a request to make a change, you're going to investigate four specific underlying emotions. You'll look both for potential causes for the problematic behaviors on the surface, and also for potential wins you can offer them, if they're willing to make a change:

 - What happens, day-to-day, that *frustrates* your stakeholder?

 - What are they *afraid* might happen at some point in the future?

 - What happens, day-to-day, that makes your stakeholder *feel good*?

 - What do they *hope* happens at some point in the future?

In the book, I go into detail on tactics for drawing emotions out, drawing on ideas from Chris Voss and Tahl Raz's Never Split the Difference.

For today, I once again recommend making an educated guess. Because Important People are, well, Important, I find that it's often possible to make pretty good guesses to start.

Once you have worked through these first two stages of the Getting Unstuck game plan, you'll be in proud possession of:

 a) A long-term outcome that you can commit to helping your stakeholder achieve

 b) An understanding of the situation they perceive themselves as being in

 c) An understanding of their fears, frustrations, delights and dreams

# Based on all of that, you can get past their immediate, day-to-day behavior, get past what they are *asking* for, and instead find a creative way to solve for their true, underlying problems. While addressing your own key concerns at the same time.

Based on all of that, you'll be able to find a creative way to offer a solution to their underlying problems, while addressing your own concerns, *at the same time*.

Of course, finding that creative way, *and* effectively pitching it to your stakeholder, brings all kinds of interesting and fun challenges of its own.

Which is what the third stage in the Getting Unstuck game plan is all about!

Let's go!

# This is not yet the pitch itself.

There's a lot of art in this -- you've got to have some sense of what "better" looks like, and what a step in that direction might be. In later posts and/or the book, I'll be sharing case studies to bring this more to life, but for now I'll sketch in some ideas.

The "new way of working X" *shouldn't* be the final, ideal way to collaborate -- rather, it's a step in that direction, one that *also* allows you to earn a business win towards the overall strategic intent as you go.

The "new way of working X" should be designed with an explicit awareness of your stakeholder's fears and hopes -- whatever they most fear should be clearly and fully prevented from happening, and whatever they most hope for should be made *more* possible.

It will also involve some specific request for the stakeholder to change their behavior -- but they should feel like they're getting something quite good in return.

With the CEO we've been discussing, who keeps on driving the team crazy by interjecting new ideas into daily work, the core structure of the increment of change might be:

/For the next six weeks, the PM and engineering lead will add a pair of recurring meetings between the two of them and the CEO: one midway through each sprint, to check in on status and learnings, one immediately after each sprint demo, to discuss options for what the team works on next./

/They'll also add a once a month meeting where the CEO will meet with the whole team and share what he's been hearing from customers -- the PM will facilitate that meeting./

/The CEO will, during these six weeks, stop coming to team standups altogether (and will not slack or email ideas to team members)./

That gives the CEO a great deal of visibility, allows them to guide the overall work of the team and allows them to "directly" share what they're observing from customers.

I'll offer two other thoughts:

First, the increment should end with a *decision by your stakeholder*

E.g. the PM and Eng lead could say to the CEO something like:

/At the end of the six weeks, we're going to sit down with you and review the team's output and velocity, and also see if and how you've been able to both understand and guide the team's work./

/If necessary, we can make any needed adjustments to ensure that you're able to make clean decisions about what problems the team is solving. Let's get that meeting on the calendar now.../

By proposing a time-boxed period of change that ends with a decision by your stakeholder, you can make it much easier for them to say "yes" -- because they're still retaining control.

Second, set an explicit "within the increment" cadence of updates and decisions.

Many of these change involve *some* kind of "leave the team alone" shifts -- in those cases, it's worth defining some clear, controlled way that the stakeholder is having opportunities to understand what is going on, and to (appropriately!) influence it.

In the example above that's built-in, via the cadence of regular meetings.

** Craft a Pitch That Creates Urgency

Okay, now you're ready to put all that together into a *pitch*.

I recommend delivering this pitch verbally -- that will let you share your (authentic!) emotional connection with their hopes and fears. If useful, you can certainly buttress that with a written memo or a set of slides.

The arc you want to lead the stakeholder through should look something like:

 - Open with the strategic intent as context

 - Signal that you want to try something new

 - Name and validate their fears, in a way that lets you demonstrate your emotional alignment with them

 - Name the aspirational positive experience you want them to have (ideally, they have not been having this experience, of late).

 - Share your own concerns and fears -- the things about how you're operating now that make you worried you won't achieve the strategic intent

 - Describe your proposed increment of change, and, as part of it, name your key request of them -- how they'll have to act differently, for a period of time.

 - Share the decision they get to make at the end of the increment

 - Ask for feedback, ideas, concerns, questions

 - Adjust based on that, and then get a commitment to try something

A note: you should practice this with a trusted friend before you pitch your stakeholder. At least once, maybe a few times. For high stakes such proposals, I practice a ton.

For our CEO friend, putting that all together, the PM and Engineering lead might say something like:

/"Our understanding is that the company's absolutely highest priority is growth, because that is what potential acquirers will want to see. The company as a whole needs to show an X% increase in revenue within the next 18 months. Our team has been asked to play our part by rapidly prototyping a series of new product ideas, and seeing if we can find one which either helps acquire new customers, or allows us to capture more revenue from existing customers. We're very excited about that challenge. However, we do have a concern that we wanted to talk about with you./

/First off, we're worried that, as we're working right now, it can feel pretty unclear to you what, exactly, the team has prioritized at any given moment. We really want to fix that. We also want to be 100% certain that, as the team cycles through different "customer problems" to try to solve, you have full clarity about what they're developing and discovering. We want to have the best possible shot at building something that you'll be super excited to share with customers./

/Unfortunately, the way we're working right now, sometimes people on the team get confused by what they hear from you, when you join our stand ups. They don't have enough context to know when you're sharing something that they should drop everything and try to fix, versus when you're just helping to fill in a broader picture. That's been causing some churn, and we're running a risk of drifting behind./

/So, we'd like to try a tweak, for the next six weeks:/

/First, to be sure you have real clarity about what's going, we'll set up a new every-other week meeting with you and the two of us, where we'll bring a detailed status update on what's been built and what's been learned -- that'll land partway through each sprint./

/Second, we still very much want you to come to the end-of-sprint demos -- that is super valuable to us and the team. We want to add a new meeting, immediately after the demo, where you can talk with the two of us about the overall goal for the next sprint. Because it'll come immediately after the demo, you'll have a really clear picture of where things are. We can all three work together to make sure the team is pointed at the most important customer problem to solve./

/Finally, if you're up for it, we'd like to have you meet with the whole team once a month to have a sort of open conversation about what you've been hearing from customers -- we think it's super valuable for the team to get a feel for what's going on in the field. I [the PM] can facilitate that, so you can just show and be ready to share./

/We'd ask that, during this six weeks, you not come to standups -- and if you have any ideas, share them with one of us, instead of emailing or slacking people on the team./

/At the end of the six weeks, we'd going to sit down with you and review the team's output and velocity, and also see if and how you've been able to both understand and guide the team's work./

/If necessary, we can make any adjustments to ensure that you're able to make clean decisions about what problems the team is solving. Let's get that meeting on the calendar now.../
