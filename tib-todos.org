Experimenting. Can I have a list of todos, outside of org-roam, but, when I'm in it, thanks to the .dir-locals, have my org-roam prefixes do what I want?

Yes, I can, apparently.

** TODO Break out todos from author platform email to EWJ
** TODO Spike: separate org-roam dir for Book     :curweek:pom:
Possibly add a capture target which throws things into the todo list there

And then, am I not using my generic agenda views there? Hmm. This feels likely right, but some genuine overhead.
