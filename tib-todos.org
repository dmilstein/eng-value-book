Experimenting. Can I have a list of todos, outside of org-roam, but, when I'm in it, thanks to the .dir-locals, have my org-roam prefixes do what I want?

Yes, I can, apparently.

Can I just export my list of contacts
** TODO Maybe: make org comments green?
Welp, this works, but I really only want it in org mode, gotta figure that out once I'm online and can ask LLM's for help.

Also, I just ran this directly, it's not in .emacs

** TODO General note: feature my own failures as learning events
E.g. things I tried that didn't work, or that I've seen people try and have not work
** TODO What the fuck -- why are my L4 org headings also in green
Oh, because org-level-4 inherits from outline-4 which inherits from font-lock-comment-face, duh.

** TODO Spike: use Deep Research on Author Platform target sites
Have a conversation about what I want, then ask it to summarize the kinds of places, types of postings, etc.

It leads to the wrong conversations, for two reasons.

And this is all about the conversations you're going to have.

The first conversation is with your engineers.

The second conversation is with your stakeholders.

Possibly add a capture target which throws things into the todo list there

And then, am I not using my generic agenda views there? Hmm. This feels likely right, but some genuine overhead.
