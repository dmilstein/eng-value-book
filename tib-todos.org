Experimenting. Can I have a list of todos, outside of org-roam, but, when I'm in it, thanks to the .dir-locals, have my org-roam prefixes do what I want?

Yes, I can, apparently.

Possibly add a capture target which throws things into the todo list there

And then, am I not using my generic agenda views there? Hmm. This feels likely right, but some genuine overhead.

** TODO Pick one title
** TODO Set up a substack
** TODO Write some form of README/About
which says "This is a place that I'll share ideas I'm working out for an upcoming book" (so I won't feel like I've made some bad promise and have internal pressure)
** TODO Review the WUB gameplan for finding places to post online
** TODO Decide if I want to do that myself or pay someone to do it for me
** TODO Map out the dumbest possible posting calendar
** TODO Build some basic habit + tooling around it
E.g. post 3-5 times/week, set up some org file that has the postings collected, and some script that uploads them for me. So it's just feeding a hopper, nothing I keep on my day-to-day todo list
