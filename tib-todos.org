** TODO For Substack, introduce/illustrate emotions a bit differently
Like, specifically say:

Understand their frustrations, so you can offer a change that smoothes those away. Understand their fears, because often, their day-to-day difficult behavior is driven by some fear of something bad happening in the future. Once you understand their fear, you can offer a new way to work together, a new way to behave, that will still ensure that bad thing doesn't happen, without their making you lose your mind. Understand what it is that makes them feel good, so you can offer them more of those experiences then they're getting right now (or ensure they don't lose the ones they have).

*** A River Runs Through it
In my family, there was never much distinction made between religion and fly fishing.
*** The Crying of Lot 49
One summer afternoon Mrs. Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million dollars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary.
*** I Capture the Castle
I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.
*** Metamorphosis
Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.

“A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.
*** The Hobbit
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.

Really, it's not specifically the story, it's making the idea feel like a full idea, instead of just dropping the reader into the tactics so abruptly.

Maybe explain *why* to go through that three part arc. Stakeholders are going to hear anything as a threat. They generally feel alone in pursuing their major goal, and alone in facing their own biggest fears.

Therefore, if you can calmly and authentically demonstrate that you understand and care about their goals and their problems, they will exhale, and be much more ready to listen to you.

Then, you can lay out your concerns, carefully doing so in a non-judgmental fashion.

At that point, you can draw your stakeholder into a collaborative problem solving session by offering a possible solution.

It's much easier to do this in small increments than as one big step -- that allows you to build trust as you to.

** TODO Lay out CPS + tech-specific context
Like, "Ultimately, what you're going to do is lay out for your stakeholder:

 - Some key long-term objective you're both working towards
 - An empathetic understanding of their concerns
 - A direct statement of your concerns, in a way they can hear
 - A proposal for a change in how you work that will address both of your concerns.

That's it. That's the whole game.

However, the reason I'm writing a *book*, is for two reasons.

First, it takes practice and skills to do those first three -- drawing out a useflu strategic objective from your stakeholder (not just some fixed numeric goal), drawing out their underlying concerns (which they are often trying to hide), and learning how to say your own clearly and cleanly.

The skills to do this are profoundly valuable, but non-trivial to learn. By sharing the contexts that I've worked in (tech companies, primarily), I hope to offer you a path in to mastering them.

Second, for the proposal to change how you work together, there are a variety of specific challenges to getting groups of humans to work together to achieve meaningful goals, specific to places for which building new software is some part of how they create value.

So I also want to off some hard-won lessons on useful changes in how you work, many of which it took me a long time to discover or work out.

E.g.

 - How do engineers and PM's handle the constant stream of demands/requests to fix or improve existing software, from one set of stakeholders, even as another set is demanding *new* software?

 - How do engineers carve out time to handle pressing issues in the "health" of their codebase, e.g. to ensure they can safely deploy, or that the system can handle increased load without collapsing, or that the company doesn't suddenly hit a brick wall because customers discover a low standard of security practices

 - How can product managers work with engineers to come up with *some* means to hit real, external deadlines for their overall business (e.g. next year's sales kick off, or the big annual conference for your customers, or the start of school for ed tech companies, or peak selling season for ecomm). These are not the made-up deadlines of the PMO, how do you hit them?

 - How can tech leaders (eng or PM), effectively work with a senior non-technical stakeholder who demands they commit to long-termd deadlines to build specific feature sets?

 - How can tech leaders gently persuade their bosses to give them sufficient decision-making authority to move quickly, day-to-day, instead of having to run every single idea up to them?

 - How can leaders break a pattern where their bosses demonstrate the awful "swoop and poop" behavior?

 - How can tech leaders work with executives who are trying to expand the market for their business by developing new products, but are trying to apply the processes, approaches and value systems they use for incrementally improving mature, at-scale products, and it's not working even a tiny bit?

So the ideas for getting unstuck just about inevitably involve a mix of how to build trust and rapport with humans, while *also* having a rich toolchest of tactics to apply in different business situations.

To that end, this book is written in two parts.

Part I - How To Solve Problems With Humans, walks through, in detail, how to draw your stakeholder into a collaborative relationship, to adjust how you work togethe.

Part II - How Humans Can Solve Problems Together, is a series of case studies on ways to approach the kinds of challenges above.

It would be great if...

But your stakeholder angrily rejects this...

Then bring what is going on for your stakeholder to life.

# Review/steal from Substack post I wrote but didn't publish yet

from stakeholder side

As in, make clear that your stakeholder isn't hearing your request as helping them achieve their goals, they're hearing it as blocking them from doing so. Plus, they have a swirl of feelings. If only you had a way to speak to those things, if you could wave a magic wand.

That magic wand has to do two things for you:

 - What is your stakeholder ultimately trying to achieve, even if they haven't told you

 - What are they afraid of, what are they hoping for?

But then, there's another problem. Software is weird. Once you have that knowledge, you need some options for better ways to work together. This is not trivial! Are there weird dependencies between teams? Is it not clear how to balance maintenance work vs new product dev? How do you lay out meaningful milestones for a year long project?

** DONE Write out 3 bad ways to clock time
CLOSED: [2025-08-18 Mon 09:19]
E.g. start/end *every pomodoro* by clocking *something*, so that's becomes part of the habit of intenionality.

Write out three bad ideas for what tasks to clock against.

E.g. create a file of clocking tasks, and just record things there (and put it the hell in git).

Or, clock detailed tasks, and roll them up.

Check on how archiving affects clocking
** DONE Try one of those bad ways to clock time

So that I don't have weird incentives to keep bad writing in.
** TODO Edmund: hours not words?
** TODO Spike: Hours not (or plus?) words as dopamine
E.g. is now the time to start logging w/ org?
** TODO Aider: split chapter count into two options

As in, use screen or something to see both at once, get my watch script running again.
** TODO Make CLI wordcount tool take a column width option

So it's actually that they might pay, but after paying, not use. The internal capital is more worrisome than the L&D budget, which is enough to get started
