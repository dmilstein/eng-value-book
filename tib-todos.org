Experimenting. Can I have a list of todos, outside of org-roam, but, when I'm in it, thanks to the .dir-locals, have my org-roam prefixes do what I want?

Yes, I can, apparently.

** TODO Spike: make org-roam keys respect .dir-locals in current directory
aka, when I'm in the shell
** TODO Spike on: tag entire file w/ gtasks (or update agenda view)
** TODO Draft note to TD looking for coaching/helping targets
** TODO Do a timeboxed skim through LinkedIn contacts for Part 2 coaching
Can I just export my list of contacts
** TODO Maybe: make org comments green?
Welp, this works, but I really only want it in org mode, gotta figure that out once I'm online and can ask LLM's for help.

Also, I just ran this directly, it's not in .emacs
(set-face-foreground font-lock-comment-face "darkgreen")
** TODO General note: feature my own failures as learning events
E.g. things I tried that didn't work, or that I've seen people try and have not work
** TODO What the fuck -- why are my L4 org headings also in green
Oh, because org-level-4 inherits from outline-4 which inherits from font-lock-comment-face, duh.

Possibly add a capture target which throws things into the todo list there

And then, am I not using my generic agenda views there? Hmm. This feels likely right, but some genuine overhead.
*** mkdir -p Projects/TechInvestBook/org-roam-tibook
*** Set up .dirlocals in there
*** git repo init w/ gitdir outside of dropbox
*** make list of tech invest book org files in org-roam/
*** cp all those over
*** git add them all
*** Add a tibook anchor file
*** Decide: where are my todos
*** Add a new capture template pointing there
*** Update Key Tasks to look in there?
*** rm all the files I moved, then git rm them

** TODO Bad first draft of Examples chapter       :curweek:
** TODO Substack: can I get my own URL?
** TODO Maybe: shorthand value by "learning what to do next"
Each thing builds on the previous, so velocity is about hitting those decision points faster.
** TODO Write template asking for connections to coach

In [[id:77C90CB8-9DA8-48D7-B534-2C448F34D489][Blog Topics]] I have a reasonable start on a ToC (still need a scope which reflects both eng + product but has some narrowness)

Something that leaves room for other things in the {Eng,Product} x Humans space
** TODO Pick one title
** TODO Set up a substack
** TODO Write some form of README/About
which says "This is a place that I'll share ideas I'm working out for an upcoming book" (so I won't feel like I've made some bad promise and have internal pressure)
** TODO Review the WUB gameplan for finding places to post online
** TODO Decide if I want to do that myself or pay someone to do it for me
** TODO Map out the dumbest possible posting calendar
** TODO Build some basic habit + tooling around it
E.g. post 3-5 times/week, set up some org file that has the postings collected, and some script that uploads them for me. So it's just feeding a hopper, nothing I keep on my day-to-day todo list

Strip comments, etc

And also on something to watch the directory for changes, re-run that and auto-update a webpage.
