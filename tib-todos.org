Experimenting. Can I have a list of todos, outside of org-roam, but, when I'm in it, thanks to the .dir-locals, have my org-roam prefixes do what I want?

Yes, I can, apparently.

* Todos
** TODO Spike: make org-roam keys respect .dir-locals in current directory
aka, when I'm in the shell
** Finish the move to separate org-roam dir
*** DONE Set up .dirlocals in there
CLOSED: [2025-05-27 Tue 07:30]
*** DONE git repo init w/ gitdir outside of dropbox
CLOSED: [2025-05-27 Tue 07:32]
*** DONE make list of tech invest book org files in org-roam/
CLOSED: [2025-05-27 Tue 07:36]
*** DONE cp all those over
CLOSED: [2025-05-27 Tue 07:37]
*** DONE sync them + verify it works
CLOSED: [2025-05-27 Tue 07:40]
*** TODO git add them all
*** TODO Add a tibook anchor file
*** TODO Decide: where are my todos
*** TODO Add a new capture template pointing there
*** TODO Update Key Tasks to look in there?
*** TODO rm all the files I moved, then git rm them
for f in `cat tmp-org-files.txt` ; do echo rm $f ; done
