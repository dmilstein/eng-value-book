* Defining Tech Investments

I believe that the metaphor of "Technical Debt" started it's life as a very useful prompt for economic thinking...

...but has now mostly drifted into a not-very-useful shorthand for *bad code*.

For reasons that apparently require a book to fully explain, I don't think engineering leaders or teams should spend much time talking about "bad code".

Instead, I recommend spending time identifying and advocating for *"Technical Investments"*, which I define as:

Work that the engineers believe is *valuable to their business*...

...but that *no one is asking for*.

The Technical Investment approach, when applied well, leads to very-useful-indeed conversations around:

 - Potential business value

 - How to make that value visible to key decision makers

 - How to safely and incrementally realize that value

Of course, bringing stakeholders along on that journey is somewhat profoundly non-trivial, so I'll be spending real time in the book on how to build trust and rapport with stakeholders, as an enabler for making major technical investments.
